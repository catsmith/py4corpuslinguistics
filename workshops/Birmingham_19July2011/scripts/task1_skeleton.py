# 1. load contents of a file into a string value named text


# 2.split the value into a list of tokens using whitespace as delimitation


# 3. apply normalization to tokens in list to:
#    a. transform to lower case 
#    b. remove trailing punctuation


# 4. count the total number of types and tokens and calculate type-token ratio


# 5. count frequency of selected words


# 6. create a frequency distribution (all types and their token counts)


# 7. sort and display a frequency list


# 8. write frequency list out to a file


# 9. create a simple index recording word positions


# 10. search for a word and produce a simple KWIC display
