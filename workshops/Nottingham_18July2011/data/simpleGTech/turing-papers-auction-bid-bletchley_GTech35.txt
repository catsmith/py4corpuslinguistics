Alan Turing was a true war hero and played an absolutely crucial role during the second world war.</p><p/><p>"The National Heritage Memorial Fund was set up in memory of those who have given their lives for the UK and this grant will now ensure that this extremely rare collection of his work stands as a permanent memorial to the man and to all those who paid the ultimate price in service to this nation."</p><p/><p>The wartime documents went under the hammer at auctioneers Christies in November with a &#163;500,000 valuation.</p><p/><p>An <a href="http://www.justgiving.com/turing-papers/" title="online campaign">online campaign</a> by IT journalist Gareth Halfacree managed to raise &#163;28,500 through public donations in just over a week. In addition, Google donated $100,000 (&#163;62,700) to the Bletchley Park bid, but it was not enough to secure the papers.</p><p/><p>Halfacree feared that the wartime papers would be bought by a private buyer and never seen again in Turing's home country.

"It's the sort of thing they'd like to have on their wall.

Those who judged him and convicted him are gone, and society has (I'd like to believe) improved and moved on. It could only be hypocrisy if those who perpetrated the persecution now suddenly lauded him, but that generation is long dead. It just sounds as though you have some personal ill feeling towards to the British, and that, frankly, is your own problem.</p><p>baggins45/cynciallyPositive -</p><p>The Poles laid the ground work before WW2, and willing met with the British who then at Bletchley moved the research forward. The code could NOT have been broken without the work of Turing's own bombes (not explosives, but rather an electromechanical decoding machine). It's fair to say the British cracked the code, with some of the groundwork done by the Polish. These are simply facts.</p><p>I'd recommend anybody interested read Alan Turing: The Enigma by Andrew Hodges.</p><p>That the Australians say it was the Poles who alone cracked the code is more a matter of politics and of the general antipathy of the Australians towards the Brits.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9729999">75</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9729999"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9729999"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9729999" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9730035"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/09/02/cta_262190_05/f4dc03d6-56cb-4752-ac66-a64a6efe7da3/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/charliecocorosie" title="User profile page">charliecocorosie</a> <p class="date">25 February 2011 7:20PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>A true hero and we should do much more to remember his contribution to all our lives.<br/>Lets see the companies who could not have made their billions without his pioneering genius cough up and fund something that will last for the world to remember him by.<br/>He helped defeat the evil of fascism and we owe him a great debt. <br/>He was subjected to bigotry and prejudice and it is right that an apology was given - now lets see something to celebrate him by.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9730035">29</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9730035"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9730035"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9730035" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9730091"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/ConfutatisMaledictis" title="User profile page">ConfutatisMaledictis</a> <p class="date">25 February 2011 7:25PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>unlearned -</p><p>Turing called the police because items were stolen from him, not by a boyfriend but by someone he'd only known for a weekend and a second accomplice.</p><p>What are you saying?

They used clever brain tricks, by chess players, crossword solvers and so on, to break codes and ciphers made by humans. They had no idea how to reliably break a cipher made by machine and didn't believe it could be done. The French were in a similar position.</p><p>The newly reborn Polish nation decided breaking codes and ciphers was vital in their position. The government recruited three brilliant mathematicians and trained them in advanced mathematics, including newly developed fields like matrices. Much of this training was at universities in Germany.</p><p>They then started investigating the Enigma, early models at the time. With the aid of an actual Enigma machine, borrowed for a weekend (there is a whole story about that), some setting information and a lot of maths they decided that the best way to break a code made by a machine was to construct a machine to do the hard work. That machine looked like the box on an ice cream seller's bike and so they reputedly named it after a make of ice cream, bomba. They had great success against early model Enigmas.</p><p>Later on the Germans introduced changes which the bomba couldn't really cope with. The Poles needed a better bomba, which the government could not afford and it looked very likely Poland was going to be invaded at some time. It would not be good for the Germans to find what the Poles had been up to. So the Polish government did something which we should all be grateful to them for to this day. They invited the British and French to a conference about Enigma. After some introductions they took the British and French into a room and showed them Polish copies of an Enigma, which stunned them. Then they showed them the bomba and the British and French were open-mouthed. They left with an Enigma each and plans of the bomba.</p><p>Realising that the Enigma could be broken, by a machine, the British vastly developed the bomba into the bombe, of which there were several versions each more advanced than the last. One of the most important British innovations was devised by Gordon Welchman (who later went on to puzzle some ideas about resilient messaging networks, today we call it Internet), the diagonal board. When this was explained to Alan Turing he came up with a way of speeding up the operation dramatically. Enigma could now be broken almost as fast at the Germans with the instructions could decipher a message. The two of them should get equal credit with the Poles for breaking Enigma.</p><p>Alan Turing was heavily involved in the ideas behind the first programmable computer, Colossus. This was used to help break an even more complicated German cipher than Enigma, which the British called Fish. The actual deciphering which produced German text was done by another machine, after Colossus helped determine how to set it up.</p><p>Colossus was amazingly advanced for the time. Data could be read at a speed which later computers only equalled in the mid 1950s. It operated in an interactive way using a dialogue, which only became common from the late 1970s. It had very flexible programming, only common from the 1960s. Some of the things it did remained classified until the 1990s, they were declassified so that the Colossus rebuild project could be given the plans by GCHQ and start the amazing rebuild you can now see at Bletchley Park. It is reputed that a Colossus or two was still used at GCHQ in the 1970s, still doing useful work. It was that good. Again Alan Turing cannot take all the credit. A brilliant GPO engineer called Tommy Flowers and his team turned these ideas into something which worked reliably at high speed. The Colossi were never turned off to keep them reliable and, with 2,500 valves each, the rooms containing them were reputed to be the only warm rooms in Bletchley Park. In the summer the rooms were so hot the women who operated them were supposed to have removed their naval uniforms and operated them in their underwear. Unusual in the early 1940s.</p><p>We have never given the Poles the thanks they deserve. Alan Turing would have got nowhere without other brilliant people, but I agree he would be a good statue to put on the fourth plinth. He would have been horrified by the idea though and pleaded to be spared that.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9730875">48</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9730875"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9730875"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9730875" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9731039"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2011/02/19/Bobdaboss/2827b8e4-76a6-4fd8-9990-5b695c04e30a/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/Bobdaboss" title="User profile page">Bobdaboss</a> <p class="date">25 February 2011 8:53PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>Being a computer scientist I can tell you: without Turing the world today wouldn't be anything like it is: between turing complete languages, turing oracles, turing prizes, turing machines, turing switches, church-turing thesis etc...

In it she reveals that Britain (to be precise Dilly Knox) were reading Engima messages sent by Italian and Spanish warships before the war broke out (in 1937 from memory). They used a manual technique called 'rodding'.</p><p>The Poles were decoding messages up to 1939 but were blacked out when the war started, because their machines relied on the Germans using double-encipherment of the indicator group.

He wasn't, that was done under Max Newman. Alan Turing's contribution was in the broader ideas behind the machine and his thoughts could be seen in things like the flexible programming, which was very useful when the Germans made changes. An electromechanical machine like a bombe had to be rebuilt to cope with major changes, Colossus was just reprogrammed. It was shown after the war that with complicated programming it was flexible enough to do base 10 multiplication, though the calculation could not be completed in a cycle. Alan Turing also introduced Tommy Flowers to Max Newman. Without Tommy Flowers and his team colossus could not have been built, another far less flexible electromechanical machine would have been built.</p><p>Two other things about Colossus that put it ahead of other machines of the era. It was controlled by a "clock" which synchronised all operations. All computers have this now, but some of the early ones built after Colossus did not. The "clock" was derived from the sprocket holes on the paper tape, so that the machine could be run at variable speed depending on how fast the paper tape was being run through the reader. It was also able to make decisions, which was particularly useful with some changes the Germans made where wheels in the encrypting machine didn't always advance regularly.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9737197">2</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9737197"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9737197"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9737197" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9737402"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2011/04/17/31428571J/80f4f365-6f1d-4c2c-ab20-e6b206586c5a/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/31428571J" title="User profile page">31428571J</a> <p class="date">26 February 2011 3:00PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>Truly a great man.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9737402">0</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9737402"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9737402"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9737402" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9737541"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/Abethdin" title="User profile page">Abethdin</a> <p class="date">26 February 2011 3:19PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>larvet,<br/></p><blockquote><p>This was basically eavesdropping at sergeant&#8217;s level.

At Princeton he advanced the idea of using em relays for logic design. He also showed the Post Office engineers the utility of theory in electronic design, and contributed to Bell Labs during WW2.

It gave useful information, though some of it was current only for a short time. By comprehensively breaking it long term information could be derived. People tend to think that Enigma was the only thing which was done there, but it was not.</p><blockquote><p>In Sweden they broke the high command code which gave an insight into the over all strategic positioning of Wermacht resources for the battles to come, all over Europe,</p></blockquote><p>Telegraph circuits between Germany and Norway passed through Sweden, so the Swedes arranged to get copies of the enciphered messages printed out. There were only a handful of links to deal with and so it was possible to break the keys by hand and use a machine to print out German, which is what the Swedes did. These messages referred to events in Scandinavia, though they might also give an insight into events elsewhere. They were detailed discussions between Berlin and various units, producing a great deal of high level intelligence which remained current for far longer than Enigma.</p><p>The British intercepted radio transmissions from the same types of machines, there were models by Siemens and Lorenz, which is a lot more difficult than tapping telegraph lines. These radio transmissions were beamed, making just the interception a great feat. At first, with a limited number of links, it was possible to do what the Swedes were doing, break the keys by hand and and then get machines to print out the German. The British broke links to Russia, Greece, Italy, North Africa and France, amongst others, so had much more intelligence than the Swedes. </p><p>As the number of links increased this became impossible to do by hand, in the time available, particularly after changes to the system in 1944. However, the British had been ahead of the game and Colossus, eventually there were ten of them, was ready in time to assist humans in the breaking of the keys. Then the messages were put into a machine, called Tunny, and the German printed out.</p><p>The Swedes did some great work, but they didn't do better than the British.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9737563">3</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9737563"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9737563"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9737563" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9737985"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/Scottishperson5" title="User profile page">Scottishperson5</a> <p class="date">26 February 2011 4:35PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>@larvet</p><p>There is a lot of misunderstanding about Bletchley Park, partly because of the decades long secrecy about the place.</p><p>They didn't just work on German systems. Italian and Japanese systems were worked on. Roy Jenkins, who later went on to be Home Secretary and found the now amalgamated Social Democrat Party, worked on Japanese systems. They are also supposed to have worked on Russian systems, though as they were allies this was not publicised.</p><p>As well as Enigma and what the British called Fish they worked on tactical codes and the like, using what one might call First World War techniques though that is to underestimate the skill and effort involved.</p><p>There are also plenty of misunderstandings on what things did. The bombes did not decrypt Enigma messages. They came up with possible settings of an Enigma machine which would produce an encrypted message. These possible settings were then tested to see if they were correct. If they were then clerical staff would set up British TypeX cipher machines, modified to work like an Enigma, with the settings, key in the enciphered message and get the German out.</p><p>Colossus had nothing to do with Enigma, neither did it decipher "Fish" messages. They helped humans determine how the German machine was set up and as more were built they helped the humans do more and more. When determined the settings were then put onto the British Tunny machine, the enciphered message tape fed in and German printed out.</p><p>They also worked closely with outstations in other parts of the Empire and with the USA. Much of the effort against U-boats later in the war was done on US Navy bombes in the USA, which had a number of advantages over the British models. Running a job on these was almost as convenient as running a job on a British bombe. Information on what to run went off by teletype and the results came back the same way.</p><blockquote><p>Presumably the Admiralty had other listening posts in the Continent.</p></blockquote><p>They had listening posts all over the place, in both world wars, as well as onboard every ship. Numerous things were done with this, including triangulation to find out where the signal came from. This could be done at a tactical level and also at a broader level, information derived from direction finding was part of the Admiralty plot.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9737985">4</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9737985"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9737985"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9737985" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9738204"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2011/02/21/Leconfidant/53b9fdec-9d15-403e-8c4e-7e7c08f971c5/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/Leconfidant" title="User profile page">Leconfidant</a> <p class="date">26 February 2011 5:08PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>At last, some good news. </p><p>And YES, his history does need preserving. </p><p>The last I remember was the movie with Kate Winslet as the secretary who 'looked good without her glasses' forming the romantic opposite to the character representing Turing's role as codebreaker. </p><p>I wonder how much luck she would have had with the real Turing, sexually or intellectually?</p><p>I guess there are always a few Nazis anxious to rewrite history so they can forget the real lessons.</p><p>Mind you, the previous Hollywood effort suggested the codebreaker was an American as well as straight. </p><p>Wars will never be history while history itself is such an ongoing war.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9738204">3</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9738204"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9738204"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9738204" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9738232"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/theoriginaljones" title="User profile page">theoriginaljones</a> <p class="date">26 February 2011 5:13PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p class="moderated">This comment was removed by a moderator because it didn't abide by our <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/community-standards">community standards</a>.

Once that was established, it became possible to cross-check. Sigint was part of the whole, but key to the Battle of the Atlantic was the information it gave about U-boats. Your simplistic description omits the strategic picture. Bletchley needed to be filled with the best experts the country could obtain and spare because of the complexity of its business.

The code the Swedish professor (in math.) Anders Beurling 1905-1986 managed to break was those using the German G machine which Beurling managed to build a copy of even never having seen the German machine. The Enigma had 17000 alternative positions while the G machine had 18 digits alternatives. The professor was not gay but apparently a hard drinker. The Swedish counter intelligence needed a number of telex printers to quickly print out solved messages and Sweden were short of them and could neither get any from Germany but bought a number from USA. These were stored in Liverpool and loaded on board the Swedish steamer Atos which however was torpedoed on August 2nd 1940 the day after departing from Glasgow. The master was an acquaintance of mine being from my home town. However the Government managed to get hold of some printers from other sources. It is correct that the Swedish managed to listen in on the telephone and printer cables running from Germany to Norway, but lost this following slack security and allowing Finish officers to more around freely in the Army High Commands office in Stockholm.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9741154">1</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9741154"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9741154"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9741154" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9743223"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/Northener" title="User profile page">Northener</a> <p class="date">27 February 2011 7:03AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>(Abethdin)<br/> </p><blockquote><p>Northener,<br/>And you don't understand how Bletchley worked.

They thought that the military Enigma could be broken, but nobody would go to all the trouble of doing so and, even if they did, the message would be of little value by the time it was decrypted.</p><p>What they didn't realise was that mathematics could reduce the amount of work necessary to break Enigma to that which first hand methods and then a combination of hand and special purpose machines could do in a reasonable time. They also didn't realise that because military people thought Enigma was unbreakable they would use it in several sloppy ways which made it easier to break. Lastly they didn't realise that success bred success. As long as it was being broken regularly it was relatively easy to continue to break it. The British deployed vast resources on this.</p><p>They thought the Siemens and Lorenz ciphers, which the British called Fish, were unbreakable. The first British break into these were the result of a German clerk doing something which was forbidden, but because the system was "unbreakable" he didn't see the problem in doing that. Later on when it was being broken with the aid of Colossus the process was for Colossus to try millions of possible keys against an enciphered message. The output was a statistical analysis of whether the result of these tests was more like German than the enciphered message. They started off with a couple of the wheels, if some of the settings looked more German like than the raw message they would look at the other wheels and so on until the job was done. The message was being read at 5000 characters per second and it could take several hours to do all the runs, which gives an idea of the number of possible keys which were tried. Colossus is still fast at this job due to another feature which only came to other computers much later. Colossus is a massively parallel machine.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9744768">1</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9744768"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9744768"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9744768" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9744898"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/Scottishperson5" title="User profile page">Scottishperson5</a> <p class="date">27 February 2011 11:43AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>@larvet</p><blockquote><p>There appear to be some people in England that is aware that Sweden was in the forefront of solving foreign codes.</p></blockquote><p>Any history of the subject worth reading will cover what was done in Sweden.</p><blockquote><p>Beurling managed to build a copy of even never having seen the German machine.</p></blockquote><p>Neither did the British.
