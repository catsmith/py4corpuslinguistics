<div id="article-body-blocks"><p>The European commission has decided against introducing legislation to protect <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/net-neutrality" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Net neutrality">net neutrality</a>, saying media scrutiny and giving consumers enough information about their <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/internet" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Internet">internet</a> service provider will be sufficient to protect an "open and neutral" internet.</p><p/><p>Legislation to prevent telecoms companies from introducing a tiered internet, with some content arriving faster than others, has been ruled out.</p><p/><p>In a long-awaited report on its approach to net neutrality, the EU executive on Tuesday said "traffic management", or the prioritising of some packets of information over others, "is necessary to ensure the smooth flow of internet traffic, particularly at times when networks become congested".</p><p/><p>Internet service providers have long argued they should be left alone to co-ordinate the flow of data through their networks, a position the commission has decided to endorse.</p><p/><p>"There is broad agreement that operators should be allowed to determine their own business models and commercial arrangements," the report continues.</p><p/><p>Commissioner Neelie Kroes, head of the EU's Digital Agenda department, said she will continue to monitor the sector for instances of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/isps" title="More from guardian.co.uk on ISPs">ISPs</a> blocking or throttling access to certain services, especially voice-over-internet-protocol offerings such as Skype.</p><p/><p>Brussels admits there have been some instances of unequal treatment of data by certain operators, including throttling of peer-to-peer <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/file-sharing" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Filesharing">filesharing</a> or video-streaming in the UK and five other EU states, and blocking or charging extra for VOIP services in six other countries.</p><p/><p>But these problems were usually fixed as a result of bad press or via action by regulators, the report concludes: "Many of these issues were solved voluntarily, often through intervention by the [national regulators] or pressure created by adverse media coverage."</p><p/><p>However, the commission has asked BEREC, the European electronic communications regulatory group, to investigate the extent of the issue. If by the end of the year Brussels finds that there are persistent problems of blocking, the commission will take additional action.</p><p/><p>"If I am not satisfied, I will not hesitate to come up with more stringent measures," said Kroes. These measures could include "guidance" or a law to prohibit blocking of services.</p><p/><p>But a "horizontal" bill, akin to that introduced by Chile last year, which goes beyond the problem of blocking and prevents any kind of tiered internet at all, the commission believes is unnecessary.</p><p/><p>Last June, Chile became the first jurisdiction in the world to pass net neutrality legislation, forcing ISPs to "ensure access to all types of content, services or applications available on the network and offer a service that does not distinguish content, applications or services".</p><p/><p>According to EU digital agenda spokesman Jonathan Todd, this goes too far: "The EU telecoms market is already healthily competitive. If an online service provider is confronted with extra charges for their content, they'll just tell the ISP to take a hike. It's a false debate."</p><p/><p/><p>Digital rights advocates for their part accused Brussels of succumbing to lobbying from the telecoms industry, saying consumers are not as able to "vote with their feet" as the commission believes.</p><p/><p>"This simplistic spin does not stand the test of reality. In practice, millions of users can only chose one operator to connect to the internet, either because of geographical or commercial constraints," said La Quadrature du Net, a France-based online civil liberties group.</p><p/><p>"Ms Kroes is hiding behind false free-market arguments to do nothing at all," added J&#233;r&#233;mie Zimmermann, a spokesman for the organisation. He said that infringements of net neutrality are not an abstraction but already common to most mobile internet provision.</p><p/><p>"In most EU member states, mobile phone operators agree on engaging in the very same discrimination in their so-called 'mobile internet' offers. These operators simply do not offer access to the universal platform of communications we call 'the internet'."</p></div>

These principles are so critical to the success of the Internet that they must be part of present and future policy for the Internet. So, while competition is vital to the open Internet, it must go hand-in-hand with equal commitment to transparency and access.</p><p>The Internet Society believes that one of the most important criteria for defining real and effective competition is transparency in service offerings so that users have a choice of Internet service providers and are able to make their informed decisions regarding choice. </p><p>Nonetheless, the Internet Society would like to remind the European Commission that it has much work still to do in this area and will need to keep monitoring the situation closely.</p><p>Frederic Donck, director of the Internet Society&#8217;s European regional bureau</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this

First, is the idea that, e.g. Sky Broadband might prioritize the Sky On-Demand service over the BBC iPlayer i.e. that the ISP might also be a content provider. Secondly, that the content provider might pay the ISPs for the right i.e. that it's not the ISP demanding extra money, it's the ISP being given extra money!</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment" class="recommend" onclick="recommendComment(10432775);return false;">Recommend?</a> (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10432775">2</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10432775"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10432775"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10432775" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10436998"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/meestersmeeth" title="User profile page">meestersmeeth</a> <p class="date">20 April 2011 8:23AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>Of course it's been ruled out.

This is why the technical route to prioritizing a packet has been approached from the client end i.e. some form of header value (perhaps at IP level) with a priority bit set (or bits) and this value is respected.</p><p>Deep Packet Inspection is not decentralized, it requires the ISP to classify a packet by looking inside it, decide what it thinks it is and prioritize accordingly. They can only decide what should be prioritized by what they know about. If I come up with VOIP2.0, some radical new ultra efficient protocol but the ISP doesn't recognize it I'm sunk. My new great new idea dies because the user experience on one network or another is poor.</p><p>The internet would become a mine field of rule based systems. These systems would interact poorly:<br/>ISP #'1 likes skype but ISP#2 doesn't, my packet quickly traverses through ISP#1 only to be held up at ISP#2 i.e. the worst policy based throttling ISP you travel through dictates the behavior of your connection and ISP#1 (the people you pay for the service) can do nothing about it.*</p><p>I completely agree that a purely decentralized priority system cannot work, it is too open to abuse. I also agree that some form of legislation is needed to make this happen but like you say the policy and thus the legislation needs to be spot on. I don't see anything in this legislation that promotes the balance that's needed.</p><p>*This already happens but in a more natural way i.e. purely due to congestion. In this scenario the most congested ISP will be the slowest link and again there's nothing you can do about it. The difference being no malicious intent in this case.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment" class="recommend" onclick="recommendComment(10442450);return false;">Recommend?</a> (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10442450">1</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10442450"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10442450"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10442450" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10443458"> <li class="comment-author" id="end-of-comments"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2011/03/10/KrisBu/74a5d645-0db0-494d-aa74-618339543067/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/KrisBu" title="User profile page">KrisBu</a> <p class="date">20 April 2011 2:34PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>@AnotherRaoulDuke<br/>I see your point and think we agree that probably somewhere in the middle ground is the best answer.</p><p>I'm perhaps naive in belief that all ISPs prioritise real time traffic like VOIP; Gaming etc and de-prioritise P2P/newsgroups with the middle queue for everything else. Certainly all the policies I've seen from UK ISPs at least seem to stick to this as its fairly common sense. Ultimately; failing to follow this will likely mean decreased customer satisfaction and possible increased churn.</p><p>In the above case and from my optimistic point of view; your VOIP2.0 traffic is likely middle queued until its recognised as requiring higher priority. Essentially; you start to see "Other" traffic volume increase and your IP engineers investigate the cause hopefully quickly resolving its plight.
