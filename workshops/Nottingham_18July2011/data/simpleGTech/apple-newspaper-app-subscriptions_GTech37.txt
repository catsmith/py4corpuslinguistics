<div id="article-body-blocks"><p><strong> </strong></p><p>There was a time, not so long ago, when <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/apple" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Apple">Apple</a> was heralded as the saviour of the publishing industry. Steve Jobs's company would miraculously convince a generation to pay for online news. Its "Jesus tablet", the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/ipad" title="More from guardian.co.uk on iPad">iPad</a>, would be so popular with consumers that they would be seduced into paying for a new generation of publishers' <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/apps" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Apps">apps</a>.</p><p>That was until last week, when Apple's relationship with the media industry came to a head. With a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/feb/15/apple-subscription-service-app-store" title="bold new set of terms for digital subscriptions"> new set of terms and conditions for digital subscriptions</a>, described as "brazen" by one national newspaper executive, publishers' inherent wariness towards the company quickly turned into a deep mistrust.</p><p>The drama, though, was yet to begin. While media bosses were still getting their heads around Apple's strict new regime, Google <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/feb/16/google-one-pass-launch" title="fired a shot across its rivals bow">fired a shot across its rival's bow</a> with its own, very different attempt to woo newspaper and magazine publishers.</p><p>Within 24 hours, the landscape of online news looked radically different. Apple's natural allure for media types – it&#160;commands <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/08/25/us-ipad-idUSTRE67O47F20100825" title="a 70%-plus chunk">a 70%-plus chunk</a> of the&#160;nascent tablet market – was shaken. And Google had potentially opened the door to more paywall products.</p><p>Apple's new terms of service dictated that the company keeps 30% of revenue from the growing number of publishers in its App Store, including the New York Times, Daily Telegraph, and the Guardian. Publishers can set the price and duration of a subscription, but they are not permitted to offer cheaper deals outside Apple's walled garden. On top of that, all the lucrative customer information stays with Apple.</p><p>Google's One Pass, by contrast, allows publishers to charge for as much or as little content as they wish, on mobiles, online, and on tablet computers. Set clearly in opposition to Apple's monolithic approach, Google allows publishers to set their own payment plan, keep 90% of&#160;the revenue, and all of the lucrative customer information.</p><p>But Google's strategy is not without flaws – the announcement was clearly rushed out a day after Apple's statement, in an effort to recruit publishers to its Android platform.</p><p>The distinction could hardly be starker. And if Apple could feel its ears burning on Thursday, it should look to Heathrow, where an influential industry body, <a href="http://www.inma.org/modules/article/index.cfm?articleid=45566" title="International Newsmedia Marketing Association (INMA)">the International Newsmedia Marketing Association</a> (INMA), hosted a hastily convened summit with digital executives from almost 60 news organisations, including the Daily Telegraph, Le Monde, Dow Jones and Axel Springer.</p><p>Mark Challinor, Telegraph Media Group's director of mobile, was there. "Apple's new policy has certainly made publishers sit up and say, 'Is 30% fair?'," he says. "We've got no problem with paying Apple a fee, but the question in light of Google's One Pass is, is 30% fair?</p><p>"I don't think this is about Apple trying to be forceful or anti-<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/newspapers" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Newspapers">newspapers</a>, it's just a case of them learning as they go – they've not had customers like us before. There's an assumption that Apple have all the answers – they really don't," adds Challinor, who is also the European board director of the INMA. "There is a definite need for a dialogue, not a monologue, with Apple here."</p><p>The Financial Times, which generated a tenth of its new digital subscriptions from its iPad app last year, expressed "concerns over changes to an approach that has so far worked well for our readers and the broader publishing ecosystem around tablet devices, and that may compromise our business model".</p><p>Although Google's rushed launch seems to have rankled with some publishers – the Daily Mail's parent company Associated Newspapers, Google's only publicly named UK launch partner, wasn't even ready to discuss its One Pass plans last week – Apple's move appears to have done more lasting damage.</p><p>The iPad-maker's new demands brought to the fore lingering concerns about its zealously enforced philosophy. "From the conversations I've had with publishers, Apple should experience some doubt [about its subscription policy]," says James McQuivey, a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/digital-media" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Digital media">digital media</a> analyst at Forrester. "The way Apple has approached this is particularly offputting for publishers – dictating terms and pulling the rug out from under their feet.</p><p>"That has definitely affected the way publishers will view Apple from now on. We're not going to see any more major publishers – except for maybe Rupert Murdoch – stand up and say Apple is doing us a favour. Those days are gone."</p><p>The reverberations of Apple's five-paragraph announcement were keenly felt elsewhere across the creative industries. The nascent music subscription market, with the likes of Spotify, We7 and Rhapsody, was immediately rendered "economically unviable", according to Steve Purdham, chief executive of the Oxford-based We7. Richard Jones, the co-founder of Last.fm, <a href="http://pastebin.com/VFfkh8QL" title="put it more bluntly">put it more bluntly</a>: "Apple just fucked over online music subs for the iPhone."</p><p>"It's no surprise that the response across the board is a feeling of absolute shock and horror," Purdham says. "But if you take a step back it's not an unexpected tactic. All Apple's doing is putting a stake&#160;in the ground and saying, 'We have a platform, you operate on that platform, so we would like to have a share of your revenue please'."</p><p>The INMA will reconvene its industry-wide meeting in May. In the meantime Apple is expected to come under intense pressure from publishers to reconsider its terms of service, in the light of Google's less prescriptive way of doing things.</p><p>"In the big picture, this is very interesting," McQuivey says. "Content companies are wary of both Apple and Google – they don't want either to win. But I would characterise this week as a footnote in chapter one – with 10 chapters left to go."</p></div>

They will pretty much have to leave the iOS ecosystem entirely. Since I use all three of those regularly, this will leave me worse off.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9662270">4</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9662270"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9662270" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9662270" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9662305"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/GollyJosh" title="User profile page">GollyJosh</a> <p class="date">21 February 2011 1:11PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>What a pity modern mobile devices don't come with web browsers so you can just go to a publishers website and pay for their content.<br/>This was dealt with years ago by paypal.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9662305">1</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9662305"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9662305" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9662305" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9662339"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/meestersmeeth" title="User profile page">meestersmeeth</a> <p class="date">21 February 2011 1:13PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>Jsanders: are you not aware that MS announced that their own app store takes 30% of the price paid by customers?</p><p>Educate yourself.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9662339">0</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9662339"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9662339" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9662339" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9662351"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/jsanders" title="User profile page">jsanders</a> <p class="date">21 February 2011 1:14PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <blockquote><p>What a pity modern mobile devices don't come with web browsers so you can just go to a publishers website and pay for their content.</p></blockquote><p>It's no good for premium video suppliers, though - the lack of Flash means that there is no effective way of applying DRM to your video stream, and so film and TV studios won't let it be used.

But the system Apple are insisting on is guaranteed to lead to most subscribers coming from the in-app purchasing system - how many people are going to go to the trouble of finding the website and signing up instead of just clicking on the button in the app? Especially since the publisher can't make it cheaper to do so, or even make it easy by using a link. </p><p>I'd have no problem with it if they just offered in-app purchasing as an option for publishers - several publishers would definitely choose it, as they wouldn't have to worry about payment processing etc. The problem is that it's being made compulsory and any alternatives are being unfairly limited.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9662733">1</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report">

Native apps are a very good thing, but they should not be required merely in order to present content such as text, pictures and video. The appropriate role for native apps is games, utilities, and so on, not content delivery. It is good that Apple bowed to pressure to allow native apps. However, it is <i>not</i> good that the browser on the iPhone is apparently inadequate for doing what web browsers are supposed to do, namely, present web pages including text, images and video.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9668636">4</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9668636"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9668636" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9668636" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9668661"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/23/undersinged/f910a4eb-0ae4-4cd6-8ad9-bfc1da582600/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/undersinged" title="User profile page">undersinged</a> <p class="date">21 February 2011 7:51PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>The iPhone's market share has been stagnant for the past year or so, while Android's has been rocketing upwards.

Create READER/PLAYBACK APP that has NO in-app sales or out-of-app SALES CAPABILITY (like the GoodReader App - which already reads PDFs, Word Docs, MP3s, Video, etc.). </p><p>This reader app can get content by downloading from DROPBOX (or iDisk, WebDAV Server or FTP server) or uploading from iTunes Sync. This reader can read or play DRM'd content (via ID and Password) AND non-DRM'd content (including the user's own content. By being able to play content from others, the app is NOT SPECIFIC to the publisher's own content.</p><p>2. Create a WEBSITE that is also a WEB-APP (which can be downloaded to the iPhone or iPad or iPod) which allows the purchase of content. </p><p>The content is then either downloaded to the users computer OR DOWNLOADED TO THE USER'S DROPBOX ACCOUNT (or iDisk, WebDAV, or FTP Server). The WebApp has absolutely no restrictions from Apple when installed on the iPhone.</p><p>With this solution, the company selling the content or subscription gets to keep 100% of the profit.

I showed her the button and she tapped it and it took her to the Kindle store. Pretty transparent process in my opinion but it confused her. Now she needed to set up an Amazon account. She then chose her book, and went to buy it, and had to carefully examine the screen to see what was going to happen next - where would it be downloaded to? How would she access it? Now all these questions are actually simple - it downloads direct to your iPad, job done.</p><p>But to someone who does NOT deal with technology daily, this is a process she needs to work out first, as it involves two separate apps and a non-standard, albeit clever way of getting the book onto the iPad (standard being, plug it into iTunes).</p><p>With iBooks it's all done in-app and the user is left with no doubt as to what's going on.</p><p>I can imagine this post will be scorned by people who can't comprehend that there are people in the world who don't know how to use digital devices like us geeks do, but I'm telling you: it's not always as obvious as you'd think.</p><p>And that is what Apple wants - the option for the user to do everything in-app if they want, and to not be fleeced an extra 43% by doing it that way as opposed to doing it outside the app, in Safari, say.</p><p>That of course means Apple implicitly acknowledge that publishers may want to cover the 30% cut to Apple by raising their in-app prices, which means they also implcitly acknowledge that the fee may eat into publishers margins.</p><p>Apple can charge whatever fee they want, I guess. I just happen to think that this particular fee, and this particular way of doing things has a strong likelihood of leaving iOS users without certain superb apps they currently enjoy, such as Kindle or Spotify.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9675884">0</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a

But that doesn't mean that other systems are so confusing that they need to be eliminated (or, at least, hugely discouraged) as a benefit for users.</p></blockquote><p>Your first sentence here answers this whole side of things. It's as simple as that. If there is currently a method of subscribing published content in an app that isn't the in-app purchase system, Apple wants people to change to that so it's a simple system. The fact is that if there's a way to subscribe to app content that isn't giving Apple a cut, it's not the simplest method there could be.</p><p>Apple isn't stopping anyone from letting publishers offer the exact same in-app content from outside the app, such as via a website, and they won't demand a cut of that. But Apple want to be sure that the only system people are using to subscribe to content inside an app is the easiest, simplest way, which happens to be there way.</p><p>Which leads us on to:</p><blockquote><p>It seems pretty clear to me that Apple's attempt to defend the moves by appealing to a putative consumer benefit are transparently self-serving. </p></blockquote><p>You're referring to the fact that Apple just got themselves a potentially massive new source of revenue, and you're right. I am still chewing this over. Most of me still thinks it's a heck of a bad deal considering the difference between what your 30% gets you as a developer and what it gets you as a publisher.</p><p>But, Apple have marketed and sold hundreds of millions of iOS devices, almost all of which will be potential customers. I do definitely think that this is worth a percentage of the sale when it's made from one of these devices as opposed to being made in a desktop browser, say.</p><blockquote><p>As you point out, there are plenty of shopping apps which won't be affected by this - if Apple's solely concerned about the user experience, why not enforce this here as well?</p></blockquote><p>Not sure, but I do know that these apps aren't publisher/subscription apps and therefore aren't covered. Perhaps it's because these apps aren't serving content to the device.</p><blockquote><p>(W)hile Apple can claim that they are just worried about poor consumers being fleeced, it seems much more likely that their main concern is that consumers wouldn't choose in-app purchasing if the added cost was reflected in the price.</p></blockquote><p>I'd say it's both - it is as much based on their business model as it is on their commitment to the customers. You really seem to believe that they don't really care about the customers and it's just a very convenient excuse to hide the fact they want to make money.</p><p>Apple are a business, the purpose of which is to make money.

The only difference is the cut - if the customer buys it from our device, we get a cut. If they don't, we don't.</p><p>And it's as simple as that.</p></blockquote><p>I say again, the only issue here is that the percentage could force some publishers off the app store and that isn't good for us. That's a risk. But, if publishers can get their pricing model for subscriptions right, they could easily sell a hell of a lot more content to people 'just trying out a couple of months', say. And assuming the content is good enough, they could win long term customers. Millions of them. And with no scaling costs such as paper, ink, printing press time, delivery vans, etc, they could turn some serious profit.</p><p>I don't see why this is so hard for people. See past the fact that Apple likes to make money (shock horror) and see the potential positives for all sides. </p><p>Because, where's the anti-competitive angle in forcing publishers like Conde Nast or News Corp out of the App Store? Apple don't have competing newspapers or magazines. They've got a shitty book store that hardly anyone uses anyway.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9682417">0</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9682417"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9682417" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9682417" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9682435"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/meestersmeeth" title="User profile page">meestersmeeth</a> <p class="date">22 February 2011 5:39PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>If the percentage does prove to be too much and publishers all bail out, I believe Apple will make some changes.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9682435">0</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9682435"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9682435" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9682435" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9703099"> <li class="comment-author" id="end-of-comments"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/23/RoyRoger/9090159a-3391-48a2-9fa7-bc18cbd1e41a/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/RoyRoger" title="User profile page">RoyRoger</a> <p class="date">24 February 2011 6:36AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>My son says he owns an Apple iphone.</p><p>I said <b>NO you don't </b>it belongs to Apple. </p><p>It imposes restrictions therefore impedes general freedoms therefore the device cannot be truly owned by the owner. </p><p>I think Apple should be paying it's customers to use it.</p><p>Am I alone?</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9703099">4</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9703099"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9703099" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9703099" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </div> </div>
