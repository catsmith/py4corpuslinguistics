<div id="article-body-blocks"><p>The analysts clearly <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2011/mar/30/android-smartphone-apple-shipments">believe the Windows Phone OS has a bright future</a>, but how about app developers? <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/microsoft" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Microsoft">Microsoft</a> made its latest pitch this week at its <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/">MIX11 conference</a> in Las Vegas, giving attendees another look at the next version of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/windows" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Windows">Windows</a> Phone, and the development features around it.</p><p>The company's corporate vice president of Windows Phone program management, Joe Belfiore, says that the key aim is to help developers make <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/apps" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Apps">apps</a> that are "even faster, more capable and better integrated with Windows Phone", while also promising to put developers "at the forefront of 'what's next'".</p><p>It's a slightly gruesome soundbite – in my experience, a lot of developers are resistant to jam-tomorrow rhetoric, preferring to seek their fortunes at the forefront of what's making money right now. Even so, the messages and demos coming out of MIX11 show Microsoft's continuing efforts to try to position itself as a credible counterpart to iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Symbian and webOS.</p><p>Some of the new features for Windows Phone are playing catch-up to those platforms. Application multitasking for background processing, audio and file transfer and fast app switching for example – something that should have really been in Windows Phone 7 at launch. Likewise providing access to the camera and motion sensor library, with Microsoft highlighting augmented reality as one of the key areas to benefit.</p><p>In other ways, Microsoft wants to get developers tying their apps more deeply into its mobile OS – for example, by making use of its Live Tiles feature to display more information on the home screens of Windows Phone handsets. The company already wants developers to make their apps fit neatly into the visual aesthetic of Windows Phone 7.</p><p>The results are good for users, but arguably riskier for Microsoft if it increases the perception among some developers that taking apps to WP7 requires more investment.</p><p>But credibility remains the main message of MIX11, with Microsoft showing demos of new apps from Skype, Spotify, Amazon and Layar among others that will make use of the new features in its next major update to the Windows Phone OS. The analyst perception of the smartphone market as (at least) a four-horse race is increasingly shared by the bigger internet services.</p><p>The question is whether developers, media companies and brands are reaching that tipping point too. This week saw <a href="http://www.pocketgamer.biz/r/Various/Windows+Phone+7/feature.asp?c=29017">rumbles from games developers</a> about lower-than-expected revenues from Windows Phone 7, while many of the brands and publishers – if they're looking beyond iOS – can currently only see as far as Android.</p><p>When I've talked to developers in recent months, they've tended to fall into two camps when it comes to Windows Phone. One camp talks about Windows Mobile, and are essentially refusing to invest in its successor until there are proven success stories of developers making hay on the platform. The other camp talks about Xbox – Microsoft's success with that platform despite widespread cynicism in its early days – and say they are increasingly keen to get onto WP7 early.</p><p>Microsoft's <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2011/apr/01/windows-phone-7-apps">recently released stats on WP7 app usage</a> – users download 12 apps a month on average – were part of its efforts to convert more developers into the latter camp.</p><p>What do you think? As a developer, what do you think of Microsoft's efforts to establish Windows Phone as a long-term runner in the smartphone race, rather than an early faller?

Google Docs has as much functionality as many are likely to need for storing word processed documents, spreadsheets &amp; more in the cloud.</p><p>Since upgrading to a Nexus One, other Google services such as Picasa are used so pictures taken on the phone can be uploaded &amp; the integration for Facebook &amp; Twitter is also part of the "vanilla" build (i.e. it's not added on as part of a skin such as HTC Sense)</p><blockquote><p>Having apps is good, but having cloud and social network (two massive present and future advancements) is where the future lies and MS have got the lead.</p></blockquote><p>I certainly agree with you on this, despite huge jumps in local capabilities on phones by new CUP/GPU's. Unless battery tech takes off soon there's going to be a limit on what you can do with a phone in a single charge. Storing your data in "the cloud" is the future, no need to backup data, everything available wherever you are, it a great step forward. The only problem is if you decide to change "providers" how easy will it be to move from using, say Google services to Microsoft's Live offering or vice versa I wonder??</p><p>As for the original question, I expect WP7 to eventually hoover up much of the Blackberry users in a corporate setting, it could end up becoming the de-facto business phone for all the obvious reasons. It'll take a good few years but I doubt BBM is enough to keep people hooked once data charges come down or basic data limits are put in place for PAYG phones. <br/>I foresee a 3 horse race, are you corporate or hooked to XBox Live, into the style &amp; stability of Apple, or either a geek or looking for the cheapest deal (Android).</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment" class="recommend" onclick="recommendComment(10384347);return false;">Recommend?</a> (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10384347">0</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10384347"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10384347" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10384347" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </div> </div>
