        <p id="stand-first" class="stand-first-alone">The scammers behind this scheme have now begun installing software that they buy with the victim's credit card - which might mean that police can now take action</p>

<div id="article-body-blocks"><p>The scam whereby <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/18/phone-scam-india-call-centres">people in Indian call centres ring up and insist that they are calling from "Microsoft Windows Support"</a> and that they have been alerted - by <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/microsoft" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Microsoft">Microsoft</a>, or your ISP - that "your computer is running slowly because of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/viruses" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Viruses">viruses</a>" - is still going on. </p><p>And they're still charging people for their fake "help", and people are still falling for it: I get a few emails a week confirming it (and that of course is only the people who realise they've been had). If you need confirmation, Microsoft's Answers system is <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/Search/Search?SearchTerm=windows+support+centre+phone+call&amp;CurrentScope.ForumName=&amp;CurrentScope.Filter=&amp;askingquestion=false">stuffed with people asking about it</a></p><p>Until now, it has been a relatively harmless process: the call centre workers didn't leave anything (such as malware) on your computer, because that could involve the police internationally, and even in Kolkata (Calcutta as was), where the criminal gang that's behind this is based, the police might take notice. Nor have I seen any evidence that they steal details such as bank information. You got scammed for a couple of hundred pounds, but if you realised what had happened, you could get the payment reversed.</p><p>But something has changed: they seem to have started trying to install software. That takes the scam into new territory altogether, because it means that the scammers are now changing the setup of the computer, and while it's still fraud, it also now strays into fields such as the Computer Misuse Act.</p><p>The confirmation came in an email a few days ago from a man called Steven, based in Manchester, who was called from a company claiming to be "Windows Service Centre" based in East London (on the phone number 020 3318 3026).</p><p>"She advised that there were numerous error reports that had come through and that my computer was badly affected and running slow (which sounded true)," says <del>Graham</del> Steven. "I was taken through various screens, which induicated numerous warnings and alerts and it was suggested that as my computer care warranties had expired, I should purchase a new one."</p><p>Being wary, he called them back in case the phone number was fake. But of course the phone number worked: it's a VOIP line back to India. </p><p>The cost? £199 - which included the installation of Kaspersky Antivirus. With tax, it came to £240.</p><p>The scammers were careful, though: they used his card details to make the purchase. It was only afterwards that Steven realised his mistake: "I received an Invoice from "SWREG" [Digital River, a download service in the US] for the service and thought nothing of it, until I checked the possible frauds page that you have. I phoned my credit card company, who confirmed that the transaction had gone through, so I immediately cancelled my card. A friend came round and uninstalled all of the Kaspersky and other applications. I do not know for sure that this is a scam, but strongly suspect that I have been conned."</p><p>Unfortunately it is a scam, and he has been conned. But he may be able to get the money back.</p><p>If you, or someone you know, falls victim to this scam, then do three things:<br />1) contact your card issuer and get the transaction reversed<br />2) report what happened to <a href="http://actionfraud.org.uk/">Action Fraud</a>, the UK's national fraud reporting centre. It has its <a href="http://actionfraud.org.uk/watch-out-for-scams-that-use-microsofts-name-aug10">own page on Microsoft-related scams</a>, as does <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/online-privacy/msname.aspx">Microsoft itself</a>. <br />3) contact the police so you can get a crime number.</p><p>If you do a search on the phone number given, you find that it appears on a number of sites - including one calling itself YTech Solutions (ytechltd.com), which looks like another standard template for the scam; the sites are set up by the dozen, and as soon as police get one taken down, six more are ready to spring up - with similar misspellings, "privacy policies" and so on. YTechltd hides its ownership details behind a domain proxy - hardly what you'd expect from a reputable company.</p><p>People are still getting these calls - often multiple times. The clue though that there is a single gang behind all this - rather than multiple people trying their luck - comes from the fact that I've never come across anyone who has been phoned twice once they've taken out this "support". That suggests that they are keeping some sort of database - but the other question is, where do they get their database of people to call?</p><p><em>Updated: Corrected name - victim's name is Steven, not Graham. Added third thing to do - contact police. Misspellings corrected.</em></p></div>

Then there's those who simply can't be bothered to learn while there is someone around to pull their chestnuts out of the fire.</p><p>I have a friend who's been a PC user for about 10 years - currently he knows very little more about how to use computers, and how they work, than he did when he bought his first machine. Why? I have no idea. He's not stupid, but the idea that he might actually bother learn what goes on inside that beige box is completely alien to him - he is a complete technophobe. (That or he's just too lazy to learn which, on days when I'm feeling uncharitable, seems closer to the truth.)</p><p>He also uses a mobile phone that's over 10 years old and barely works, because he is utterly unable to learn how to use a new one (I know because I bought him one as a birthday present, and he gave it me back, mystified, after a couple of weeks, and that was just a very basic mobe). The idea that he might buy a smartphone, and thus have basic PC functionality with him at all times, fills him with horror. Or, quite possibly, terror. That I have two of the things, plus a netbook, is utterly beyond his comprehension.</p><p>For some years I've operated an email advice service for disabled people with computer problems, and I can tell you that this guy, far from being a rarity, is probably pretty close to the norm. After all, it's people like him that keep PC World in business.</p><p>And all have one fundamental glitch in their brain - a total RTFM failure.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9770107">26</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9770107"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9770107" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9770107" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9770114"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/Nanome" title="User profile page">Nanome</a> <p class="date">1 March 2011 9:41AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>A complete stranger wants access to your computer and you not only give it to him, but pay him to do it?

If this is happening throughout the country this must be on a massive scale. From what I've read there seems to be little you can do as an individual. If they are using voice over IP the calls cost them very little (keeping them on the line only wastes your time) and can not be traced or blocked. I suggest calling or emailing Action Fraud http://www.actionfraud.org.uk to report every time this happens.

They then have literally gigabytes of shit running in the background. I'm typing this on a netbook that has only 350mb of memory used when it starts, compared to my girlfriend's laptop which this weekend had 2gb used until I cleared all the crapware off it. Why did her browser have not one search bar thingy but five????????????</p><p>I suppose the one thing Apple's favour is there are substantially less users so there isn't as much money to be made from bundling crapware so less companies bother. Because Windows is so popular, large companies use social engineering to get people to unknowningly, or forgetfully, install shit. This has nothing to do with Microsoft and everything to do with the immorality of companies who bundle these things together - one of which is Apple. </p><p>Install iTunes and then look at the garbage always running in the background - ipodservice, ituneshelper, applemobiledeviceservice... regardless of whether you have an iPod, iPhone or anything else.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9771390">20</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9771390"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9771390" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9771390" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9771450"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/22/alexredcloud/020b8965-9709-4736-8b40-0e6a56e48b47/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/alexredcloud" title="User profile page">alexredcloud</a> <p class="date">1 March 2011 11:01AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>@Ascexis</p><blockquote><p>@alexredcloud</p><p>Not so.

We would work through a list (manual dialing) starting at tel. number XYZ 001 and working through XYZ 002, XYZ 003, XYZ 004... and so on.<br/>No need to use a directory or even to buy your number off of some firm that you'd given your number to.

It sounds as though they have charged either £200 or £240 for this, which is a touch steep, but firmly belongs in the category of overcharging (and you might want to consider how much an outsourced IT service would charge for this - I know of at least one leading supplier who wouldn't even set up an email account without authorisation of £2000!</p><p>There are far more important scams to be aware of, such as the websites that effectively try to alarm the user into either buying a product or into running dangerous code (typically a pop-up window that has only a 'yes' button). These will install very nasty stuff on your PC if you aren't protected or allow them access. It's also not just about attacking YOUR system - once compromised, they will use you to relay and attack others, and so forth.</p><p>Typically the numbers are generated from autodiallers - which is why there is often a delay when you pick up the phone. The very fact that the call to Steven HAD a return number is itself surprising - these are easily suppressed.</p><p>Gothic is right, especially about Apple being as cavalier as the next company when installing hidden services, but those smug apple users will be targets soon enough -

Make sure you remember your passwords because afterwards you will have to sign in again to many sites. Then run a full scan with your anti-virus program. For Windows XP or earlier it will help to defragment the hard drive. You can find that under accessories - system tools. Reboot (re-instal Windows) if it is still slow.

There's no use of a telephone directory involved here, beyond obtaining area codes. After that, it's a simple case of sequentially dialling the last 3 or 4 digits of a working city area code / location, as such:</p><p>xxxxx xx5351<br/>xxxxx xx5352<br/>xxxxx xx5353</p><p>And so on. You get a sheet of maybe 500 numbers and that's your day's work. Your colleague gets a sheet of the 500 numbers following yours and calls them simultaneously. It's a basic, tedious process, but it means they've dialled every single working number. It's not just cold callers from foreign countries that employ this method, but companies in the UK as well. I know, because I used to work for one of them. Although I never investigated, it's probably safe to say this is not a legal practice.</p><p>Being ex-directory is completely meaningless when cold callers use this system. You might not be listed but you're still part of the sequence. You will get called. And you won't get taken off their "database" no matter how many times you ask, because it's just a printed sheet of numbers that eventually ends up in the bin.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9776272">3</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9776272"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9776272" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9776272" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9776345"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/AzuraTheBlueDevil" title="User profile page">AzuraTheBlueDevil</a> <p class="date">1 March 2011 2:51PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>AntiTerrorist</p><p>If you'd made that argument 10 years ago, then maybe.

So stringing them along or shouting insults is not only a waste of time, it probably doesn't cost the conmen a penny or affect them in any way. You are simply upsetting someone who is probably just struggling to make a living wage.</p><p>Even the conmen probably think they have simply come up with a clever way of flogging anti-virus software with a high mark-up to foreigners who have more money than sense and won't miss a few bob. They probably do not think of it as a crime and local police, politicians and regulators probably agree. After all, we don't think it's a crime when Westerners pay £70 for a designer T-shirt that cost 50p to make in Bangladesh.</p><p>The only way to stop this kind of thing is for Western regulatory authorities to do more to block these kind of calls ... but they won't do that because MPs and regulators are terrified of upsetting companies who claim they are creating hi-tech jobs in areas of high unemployment by building call centres packed with part-time minimum wage employees. (Only tonight I read a Press release from a bank that claimed it was creating thousands of banking jobs, which sounds impressive but actually meant another call centre).</p><p>The only answer I can think of is for telecom regulators to be required to make TV and radio adverts to educate consumers about the risks of cold-calling so the really vulnerable, such as pensioners, are warned off the huge number of scams. If we can warn people about drink-driving why not Indian conmen?</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9784450">3</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9784450"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9784450" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9784450" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9786377"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/Sadet" title="User profile page">Sadet</a> <p class="date">2 March 2011 10:00AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>@backfeed <i>Why doesn't Microsoft update ASSOC to include an appropriate warning message?</i></p><p>Because it's a shell command, so its output may be piped into other programs.

Don't let anyone sell you something. If you need something then you go out and find it. If someone has contacted you to sell you something then you weren't looking for it in the first place and probably don't need it. DON'T LET ANYONE SELL YOU ANYTHING, ESPECIALLY ANYTHING YOU WERE NOT LOOKING FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE.

I have a broadband connection and was already online. i would have to exit enternet explorer and reopen to continue. i tried to remove mse and now get an error message when i first start my computer saying microsoft client secuity failed if this continues you will need to reinstall. other problem is when i am on ebay i can not change pages. when i go to control panel add and remove programe mse is still there and i can not remove it. so i go back to microsoft website to reinstall but can not select the download now icon same as when i am on ebay. so i call microsoft support they connect me remotely to another microsoft employ or so said and seemed. so he shows me the error messages on my computer and tells me that i have infected files that are causing the problems and tries to sell me $200 yearly support. i explain to him that i never before had a problem with viruses until i downloaded mse and now he is asking me to pay for mse with 24/7 support. he said that once i downloaded mse it conflicted with the viruses and the problems then arose. I said i have never before heard that a virus would not effect you not one bit unless you have virus protection. and we were talking on my wordpad so i move the cursur up to file and tried to save and he took over closed the wordpad and ended the session. microsoft security essentials is a scam and will cause you problems. stay clear of it. i do not know if it is employes that are behind this or if it is microsoft itself. but i am leaning toward both. i think microsoft is being nauty.......</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9838390">0</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9838390"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9838390" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9838390" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </div> </div>
