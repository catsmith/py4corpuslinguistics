<div id="article-body-blocks"><p>There is little that gladdens a geek's heart more than the sound of that first successful post beep from a self-built computer. So when mine finally purred into life, we were doing victory laps around my sitting room.</p><p>It had taken a long and frustrating time to reach this point. My friend John and I had decided to rebuild my ageing PC, reckoning that it would be a fun project. Plus, you can't really claim true geek cred until you've built a PC. And it's not actually that difficult to do given the standard architecture. It's not like we're back in the days of homebrew, deep in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club" title="dawn of computing prehistory">dawn of computing prehistory</a> – everything just slots together. What could possibly go wrong?</p><p>I assembled the components, going for high end, as this build was to replace the gaming rig I'd bought from <a href="http://www.voodoopc.com/hpcentral/voodoopc/history.html" title="Voodoo PC">Voodoo PC</a> when it was a boutique builder of high-performance PCs before it became part of HP.</p>    <span class="inline">
                <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2011/2/21/1298301071766/Building-a-PC-001.jpg" alt="Building a PC" width="200" height="271" />
        </a>        			<span class="caption" style="width: 200px;">
				The built-in LOLcat
			</span>
            </span>
<p>So I gathered together an <a href="http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx?id=52214&amp;wapkw=(i7+2600k)" title="Intel i7 2600K processor">Intel i7 2600K processor</a>, the top of its new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Bridge" title="Sandybridge range">Sandybridge range</a> and an <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/intel" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Intel">Intel</a> <a href="http://intel.ly/fwodK6" title="DP67BG">DP67BG</a> motherboard. As I wanted this to be a fast machine that will last me for a while, I decided to go for solid state drives, ending up with two – one for the OS and apps, and one for the data I access most, which is photographs: I do a lot of processing of images in Photoshop and Lightroom, both of which will gobble up as much speed and processing grunt as you can throw at them.</p><p>Next up – Ram. With the focus on image processing, 16GB of <a href="http://bit.ly/dO46NI (pdf)" title="DDR3 1333Mhz Ram">DDR3 1333Mhz Ram</a>  from <a href="http://www.kingston.com/ukroot/default.asp" title="Kingston">Kingston</a> seemed just the ticket. I'm also not averse to a bit of gaming, and as this was swiftly turning into a luxury build, Nvidia's <a href="http://bit.ly/eE9kpZ" title="GTX 580">GTX 580</a> seemed the obvious choice, not least because Nvidia has swapped noisy fans for a vapour cooling.</p><p>We reckoned my old 700W PSU, which was new only three years ago, would suffice; and I really like the Voodoo case the original build came in: it's big, with plenty of airflow, the fans are quiet and it's got a side panel through which to admire the computer's innards, so there was no reason to replace that. And my DVD burner, a newish SATA one I'd put in recently, would also be fine.</p><p>Stripping out the old build took a long time – it was, as was fashionable in 2005 – watercooled, so it had to be drained.</p><p>Watercooling worked well for me at the time, and I had few problems with it bar having to replace the tank once when it started to ooze. And it looked pretty cool through the side panel to see the snaking tubes carrying blue coolant around the system. But times change and we decided not to go for it this time.</p><p>All the old stuff out of the case, we assembled the new parts within it. Ready for the big switch on, we crossed our fingers and I pushed the button – only to be greeted with an alarming fizzing and popping, with all the lights on the board flashing frantically. That was a bad and scary moment. Out it came, where the same thing happened on my wooden floor. Bits were removed, the symptoms didn't go away.</p>    <span class="inline">
                <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2011/2/21/1298301248719/Building-a-PC-001.jpg" alt="Building a PC" width="200" height="161" />
        </a>            </span>
<p>Testing the PSU suggested that the voltage was all over the place, so the decision was taken to order a new one. Disappointing, as it had been fine in the old build, which, with two DX9 GPUs in SLI and a couple of 10,000rpm Raptor HDDs in Raid 0, was a power-hungry beast.</p><p>We still don't know if the old PSU coincidentally failed, or was tipped over the edge by something shorting inside the case (more on that in a moment), but either way, it was time to ditch the old one in favour of a new one, an <a href="http://bit.ly/dYKeFz" title="OCZ 700W StealthXStream PSU">OCZ 700W StealthXStream PSU</a>.</p><p>While we were waiting for this to arrive, news broke of <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/02/01/intel-sandy-bridge-chipset-flaw-identified-as-a-rogue-transistor/" title="problems with Intels Sandybridge chipset">problems with Intel's Sandybridge chipset</a> which could affect the transfer rates of serial ATA disks. My SSDs are 3Gbps, but the delay meant we could do some research, discovering that the 6Gbps connectors are not affected by the flaw, so we made a note to plug the three SATA disks – the SSDs and the DVD burner – into the 6Gps connectors.</p><p>Finally the new PSU arrived, and we reassembled the PC. The moment of the big switch on had arrived (again). We crossed our collective fingers and pushed the button. Nothing. Just a light on the motherboard, which seemed to warn of overheating.</p><p>Frustrated, we took it out of the case again and tried it on the wooden floor. This time, our hearts leapt when we got a post beep.</p><p>Back in it went – nothing.</p><p>We finally arrived <a href="http://intel.ly/fr2X02" title="at the answer via Google">at the answer via Google</a>, discovering that something shorting the board will (obviously) prevent a successful boot. Suggestions ranged from using brass standoffs (which hold the motherboard screws) to putting a rubber sheet between the motherboard and the backing plate. We went for the less obtrusive option of adding rubber spacers – which finally solved the problem.</p>    <span class="inline">
                <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2011/2/21/1298301291352/Building-a-PC-001.jpg" alt="Building a PC" width="200" height="218" />
        </a>            </span>
<p>Everything back inside the case (again; next time I'm buying a case where everything snaps in rather than having to be attached using tiny fiddly screws, and one with a removable motherboard backing plate) and finally the long-awaited post beep sounded. It's the geek equivalent of great sex. Or, at least, great chocolate.</p><p>I haven't started overclocking the CPU yet, but already it's a joy to use – fast and responsive in demanding apps such as Photoshop, and I'm looking forward to trying a really demanding game. The <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/windows" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Windows">Windows</a> Experience Index, a rough and ready indicator, gives it 7.2 out of a possible 7.9 – the system SSD is the slowest part of the rig. I'll be running proper benchmarks when I've done the overclocking.</p><p>It's been a learning experience. At times frustrating, at times downright tricky and fiddly. But the moment I first gazed upon my new PC's Bios screen is right up there with the happiest moments of my life.</p></div>

FDISK was a saving grace ;-)</p><p>Still, if you've spent enough time building your own PCs then I can guarantee one word flashed through your mind when you saw the pic of that cat sat on the tower, above: STATIC! Please remove the cat or take the picture down.

Okaaayyy.....</p><p>I hardly ever take my laptop away from home, it's strictly a home computer, but the benefits to having it over a desktop are too obvious to even go into, you can't build a laptop so where does that leave me? It's going to be an off the shelf one isn't it?<br/>Just to clarify here, because I don't want to get silly about this, are you saying that if the average consumer goes and buys an off the shelf machine for a few hundred quid, that's a bad decision?</p><p>It's always important to remember that most people just don't give a toss, just accept it. I know that playing games on a PC is technically better, but I just don't want the hassle. I want to sit on the sofa, grab a controller and play on an XBOX. I've only met one guy who built his own PC (the fact that he was a bit of an arse is irrelevant).</p><p>You can't honestly see the argument? I use Macs both at home and at work, recently my Mum was getting a new computer, if I followed standard Mac nutcase behaviour I should've frog marched her to the nearest Apple store, instead I suggested she get a Dell Netbook, since I knew that all she wanted it for was the lightest of tasks, and spunking out hundreds and hundreds of pounds on a laptop would be daft.<br/>The point is, not every solution fits, not even perfectly normal solutions fit everyone, yeah building your own probably is dead easy/saves you money. But again to keep going with the analogies, you could probably save money painting the outside of your house, plenty of us do and it's a perfectly rational, but then there's plenty who get the painters in.

You have some people saying "don't bother" and others going "laptops are a better option". The thing is, having all the different options means a person is more likely to find the ideal setup for themselves. A lot of people either don't have the confidence or simply don't want to build their own PC and that's totally cool. They go out and buy an off the shelf PC and they're happy. They haven't wasted money as they have what they want. You have people who want to build their PC and spec it out as they see fit. It may be more expensive or may be cheaper but, again, these people haven't wasted money as they are also happy with what they have.<br/>As for people buying laptops and perhaps getting more than what they need. Well if they have a system they're happy with then what's the problem?<br/>The whole argument that one way is better than another is simply stupid (in the same way you have the Mac Vs PC).

If it's something that is difficult to clean (as deeper-key keyboards are) that can be a bit of a pain in the arse too.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9686491">1</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9686491"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9686491" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9686491" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9686502"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/Avro" title="User profile page">Avro</a> <p class="date">22 February 2011 11:53PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>@ Consultation<br/>A metal box, yes aluminium rather different from your plastic petes.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9686502">1</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9686502"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9686502" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9686502" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9686528"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/Avro" title="User profile page">Avro</a> <p class="date">22 February 2011 11:56PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p class="moderated">This comment was removed by a moderator because it didn't abide by our <a href='http://www.guardian.co.uk/community-standards'>community standards</a>.

I previously had a Macbook Pro when MACs moved over to dual core Intel chips and it worked a dream, utterly lovely machine with a fab OS. This time I have gone for a Dell XPS laptop, basically for two reasons. First off the spec is mightily impressive, 8GB DDR3 RAM, Intel Core i7 processor, 640GB Hard Drive, 720p display, 2GB Graphics Card. This beastie runs quietly and never gets hot and when I priced up a MAC of a roughly similar spec it was about 3 times the price of the Dell. Secondly I like the small form factor of laptops and the fact that there are no wires connecting all the different bits together as with a desktop.</p><p>I will however at some point build another PC and it will be a desktop but I will build it just for the fun of it. I like to think of it as Lego/Meccano for grown ups.</p><p>I find it a bit sad that discussions about all things computery seem to descend into a MAC vs PC slanging match every time. Computers are fun regardless of your choice of manufacturer or indeed whether you choose to build your own. Some people on these comments threads need to pull their heads out of their arses and realise that just because they made a certain choice it doesn't necessarily follow that everyone else should make the same choice.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9686588">3</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9686588"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9686588" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9686588" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9686631"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/Consultation" title="User profile page">Consultation</a> <p class="date">23 February 2011 12:10AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <blockquote><p>Avro<br/>22 February 2011 11:53PM<br/>@ Consultation<br/>A metal box, yes aluminium rather different from your plastic petes.</p></blockquote><p><br/>Er, yes.

The analogy of paying someone to build your lego just doesn't work for me. The concept of lego is precisely about the fun and/or education of the build. It is less about the final product than the journey. You may see PC's in the same way but I think the vast majority of PC users would not. A closer analogy might be that of the kit car. Are you suggesting that maybe all drivers should build their own cars? I have no doubt that PC owners, and drivers, would learn a lot in this approach, and perhaps even save some money, but it's not a serious solution for the majority. Their considerations are likely to be very different from your own.</p><p>Hopefully this article will encourage a few interested people to give it a go.
