<div id="article-body-blocks"><p>Cairo, it wasn't. But at about a quarter to four last Saturday afternoon, on a&#160;crowded backstreet in&#160;central London, something happened outside the Egyptian embassy that deserves at least a footnote in the annals of protest history. A crowd of students weren't kettled.</p><p>In the context of recent British protests, this was a near-miracle. At&#160;each of the previous four major student protests in London since the Millbank riot on 10 November, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/police" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Police">police</a> have kettled &#8211; or, in their terminology, "contained" &#8211; thousands of protesters, preventing them from leaving an area for several hours, and often from accessing basic amenities such as food,&#160;water and toilets.</p><p>Police kettle protesters supposedly to quell violence, but protesters arguably only turn to violence out of frustration at being kettled. Most notoriously, police trapped hundreds of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/nov/24/student-protests-school-children-streets" title="teenage schoolchildren inside a tight grid">teenage schoolchildren inside a tight grid</a> on Whitehall on 24 November &#8211; and only subsequently did a few of them smash up a police van abandoned in their midst.</p><p>Saturday's non-kettle, then, was a&#160;victory in itself. But the real excitement wasn't that it didn't happen &#8211; but <em>how</em> it didn't happen. It is difficult to pinpoint exactly why police and protesters behave in a certain way at a certain time, but one explanation for the kettle's failure to form lies with a new communications network, which launched that afternoon: <a href="http://www.sukey.org" title="Sukey">Sukey</a>.</p><p>The brainchild of a group of young, recently politicised computer programmers, Sukey's main goal is to&#160;stop people getting kettled. On the day of a protest, founders collate information from individual protesters &#8211; tweets, texts and GPS positions &#8211; about what is happening on the ground. The Sukey team then update an online live-map of the protest, accessible from smartphones. Simultaneously, they tweet and text brief summaries of events to all their subscribers, telling them where other protesters are situated, and &#8211; most significantly &#8211; where kettles are forming. As the nursery rhyme (from which Sukey takes its name) aptly suggests: "Polly put the kettle on, Sukey take it off again."</p><p>And, in London last Saturday, that might well be what happened. Around 500 students coming from a 5,000- strong anti-cuts march on Millbank joined the ongoing, separate protest at the Egyptian embassy. After around an hour and a half, a few demonstrators said they had overheard <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/kettling" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Kettling">kettling</a> tactics being discussed on police radios, and thought they had seen police lines closing in. They relayed this to the Sukey team at their computers in an east London office block, and the team quickly texted the news to their entire mailing list on the ground. Recipients of the text alerted those around them, many protesters left the area, and, perhaps as a result, no kettling took place.</p><p>One of the protesters who alerted Sukey to the potential kettle was Ben, 21, a member of last year's University College London (UCL) occupation, whose participants still form a fulcrum for the London anti-cuts movement. Ben is certain that Sukey played an important role in people moving quickly away from the embassy. "Everyone who was getting the Sukey updates was telling everyone who wasn't what was happening," he says.&#160;"It took about five minutes for us&#160;to mobilise."</p><p>There are, of course, other potential explanations for what happened: a&#160;genuine softening of police tactics; an&#160;existing awareness of kettling procedure among protesters; a police double-bluff; coincidence. It is also important to note that not everyone welcomed the presence of the anti-cuts protesters outside the Egyptian embassy. Sunny Hundal, editor of <a href="http://liberalconspiracy.org/" title="Liberal Conspiracy">Liberal Conspiracy</a>, argued that those protesters who had left an education-themed march to join a rally based around foreign policy were displaying a lack of ideological direction. This, coupled with the abusing of NUS president Aaron Porter, led Hundal to conclude that Saturday's protest "was <a href="http://twitter.com/sunny_hundal/status/31540270168281088" title="when the student movement died">when the student movement died</a>".</p><p>Back at Sukey's secret nerve-centre in east London, however, the team are celebrating a measured success. "We'll take that as a win," says Sam Gaus, 19, a first-year computer science student at UCL, and one of Sukey's co-founders. There were kettles in Manchester and Edinburgh. But in London, for the first time in five marches, there was none. Coincidence? Gaus thinks not.</p><p>On 9 December, the day of the parliamentary vote on <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/tuition-fees" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Tuition fees">tuition fees</a>, thousands of protesters were kettled in Parliament Square. Many of those present &#8211; myself included &#8211; were not aware until too late that they had either strayed from the march's designated route, or were in the process of being "contained". The result: students trapped for up to 12 hours; the supreme court trashed; dozens injured; 60 arrested. In London last Saturday, with no kettles, there were only nine arrests.</p><p>Sam Carlisle, 23, an electronics engineer who graduated from Durham, became politicised after his girlfriend was trampled in a horse-charge at the protest on 24 November. Outraged, he decided to offer his exceptional technical skills to the UCL occupation, where he met Gaus. To differentiate between the two Sams, other occupiers christened them "Sam the techie" (Carlisle), and "Techie Sam" (Gaus). Physically, the pair are chalk-and-cheese &#8211; Carlisle is pale and stocky; Gaus dark-haired and tall &#8211; but intellectually they seem united. The night before the 9 December protest, both independently came up with the same idea: a live, online map that could show people at home where protest troublespots were located.</p><p>"I came to Sam on the eighth and I&#160;said: 'I've got this great idea,'" says Gaus. "And then he showed me this flow-chart with exactly the same plan."</p><p><a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=113314616990789414427.000496f96fd6739e0982d&amp;ll=51.506338,-0.126847&amp;spn=0.003599,0.009645&amp;z=17" title="The map">The map</a> was up and running for the protest the next day, prompting excited <a href="http://bengoldacre.posterous.com/student-protestors-using-live-tech-to-outwit" title="praise from Guardian science writer Ben Goldacre">praise from Guardian science writer Ben Goldacre</a> and backhanded compliments from <a href="http://www.policeone.com/police-technology/articles/3115790-Rioters-using-Google-Maps-for-real-time-information/" title="American security 00ADanalysts">American security analysts</a>. But though the map was an innovative development, because there was no way of quickly communicating what it showed to people on the ground, it didn't fulfil the Sams' ultimate goal: to help protesters avoid kettles.</p><p>So, over the next month, they set about coding what became Sukey: a <a href="http://twitter.com/sukeySMS" title="text-based warning service">text-based warning service</a> (used to great effect on Saturday); a similarly successful <a href="http://twitter.com/sukeyData" title="Twitter feed">Twitter feed</a>; and an <a href="http://sukey.org/a/" title="auto00ADupdating map">auto-updating map</a> of the protest, accessible from smartphones, which users complained didn't update fast enough. A compass-based application for smartphones, which would have told users in which direction kettles were to be found, was not ready in time. It was not through lack of effort. By the time I&#160;arrived at Sukey headquarters on Saturday afternoon, Carlisle hadn't slept in a bed&#160;for a&#160;week.</p><p>Four other team members are also integral to the process. On the march itself was Amit, who spread the gospel of Sukey to every protester he could. Then there is Tom Bance, 22, a physicist at UCL, who sends out Sukey's texts. Matt Gaffen, 23, a freelance graphic designer, devises Sukey's visuals, and Bernie, a man with greying hair who looks too old to be a student is an IT developer &#8211; and Sam Gaus's dad.</p><p>As the afternoon unfolded, it was primarily Bance's job to work out what was happening on the ground. With Marie, another UCL student, he sifted through all tweets tagged with "#sukey". Once he was clear what was going on, he relayed the synthesised information back through Sukey's official Twitter and texts. When trouble started brewing at the Egyptian embassy, for example, Bance's text read: "LOTS of reports say a Kettle is about to be formed outside the Egyptian embassy. Stay sensible, stay safe. #sukey." If, as was the case, an area looks likely to be kettled, it is the&#160;Gauses who are tasked with delineating it on the online map. Carlisle, meanwhile, was desperately trying to finish the code for the compass application, and Gaffen was on hand to update any graphics that needed changing.</p><p>"We're like a busy newsroom," says Bernie. "We have to get information in, check it makes sense, and then get it back out again."</p><p>When Sukey's arrival was announced last Friday, some critics warned it would merely facilitate rioting, rather than help keep protesters safe. Tory blogger Harry Cole said in a tweet that&#160;he has since deleted: "Is there something discustingly ironic about riot organising iphone ap http://sukey.org/ Just about says it all about this country's kids."</p><p>Some announcements made by Sukey probably did indirectly assist those protesters who were less interested in the original "A-to-B" march, and more interested in a new kind of protest tactic that has emerged in the last few months: the "civic swarm", which sees large groups of demonstrators peel off from official marching routes and instigate flashmobs at shops such as Vodafone and Topshop, but which is arguably a perfectly justifiable form of protest.</p><p>But the Sukey team take umbrage at&#160;the idea that their goal is to cause disruption rather than to aid safety. They see themselves as distributors of information rather than battle tactics. Early in the day, they had sent out a text reminding everyone about the exact route of the march; later, they ended every announcement with the suffix: "Stay sensible, stay safe." When the march ended, and split into three groups of protesters, the team had a brief debate about whether they should carry on texting and tweeting. "We aren't there to lead people to the palace gates for the revolution," says Gaus Sr. By reporting the activities of the three meandering groups, he feared that "effectively, we're not just supporting it, we are instructing it". Eventually, however, they agreed that it is exactly at those moments that protesters are in need of information. "We're never going to be able to stop people leaving," Gaus Jr points out. "But when they do leave, and there is trouble &#8211; that's when we can be most useful. We can protect people from those troublespots."</p><p>Sukey is by no means the finished article. Though the events outside the Egyptian embassy seemed like a genuine success, plenty of people were frustrated that the compass-based application wasn't ready, and that the&#160;live map was either difficult to decipher, or slow to load and update. Additionally, since mobile phone reception is often scarce at protests, some complained that texts took too long to filter through. Carlisle accepts these criticisms: "I'm expecting people to come back and say it's shit, it doesn't work." But for him, it seems Saturday was almost a dry-run for future, larger protests, such as the Trades Union Congress protest on 26 March, which might attract hundreds of thousands of protesters to London.</p><p>But even if Sukey isn't yet working like clockwork, it appeared to have two effects on Saturday. Several activists said just the knowledge that such a communications tool was in operation made people more aware of the need to share information, and to keep in touch. Similarly, there was a sense inside Sukey HQ that their presence was, at least in part, making the police more careful about their behaviour.</p><p>It would certainly make sense for the Metropolitan police to pay close attention to Sukey: communication is not the police's strongpoint. On a day when students were keeping in touch by Twitter and mobile phone, the police were <a href="http://london.indymedia.org/articles/7083" title="handing out little slips of paper">handing out little slips of paper</a>. As Bance says: "The police don't understand Twitter. They might as well be shouting at the screen with a megaphone."</p><p>There is an argument going on about&#160;the part technology has played in recent protests across Europe and&#160;north Africa. But while it is lazy to&#160;brand these revolts "twitter revolutions", as <a href="http://twitter.com/evgenymorozov/status/11822932917" title="Malcolm Gladwell and Evgeny Morozov">Malcolm Gladwell and&#160;Evgeny Morozov</a> have broadly argued, it seems equally silly to deny that social media does not have a role&#160;to play in facilitating protest and&#160;debate.</p><p>Sukey seems a prime example, and endorsement comes from an unlikely source: Tim Hardy, the founder of a blog called Beyond Clicktivism, and a self-proclaimed cyber-sceptic. Six months ago, sick of the excesses of social media, Hardy removed himself from Facebook and Twitter. "It was difficult to know what to listen to," Hardy says. "As Clay Shirky says, the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/internet" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Internet">internet</a> needs more filters." But in Sukey, Hardy thinks he has found one such filter. He was so impressed by what he had seen, that by the end of Saturday he had agreed to be the team's spokesman. "It's really being used to enable something to happen," he says.</p><p>Quite what Sukey will go on to enable is not yet clear. The team plan to make their coding available to protest-minded programmers across the UK, but it remains to be seen what kind of impact it could have in, say, Egypt, where the government recently cut off the two keys to Sukey's London success: mobile and internet access. To&#160;stay ahead of the curve, Sukey will&#160;have to find ways round these problems. Protesters in Egypt have already improvised by using dial-up connections and new "speak to tweet" technology, which converts voicemail recordings into Twitter messages.</p><p>Further afield, international programmers from the Open Mesh Project are developing a system that turns laptops into temporary internet routers, and so allows protesters to&#160;communicate even without a conventional internet connection. But&#160;Sukey is unlikely to be behind the&#160;times for long. The team are tight-lipped about the details, but two of them say they might have found a way of doing without mobile reception. "We've got some ideas," says Gaus Sr, with a grin.</p></div>

I noticed the police all but directly respond to information that had come out shortly beforehand via Sukey at least twice, and a friend who wasn't at the protest commented on how the police account was 'far more informative and far less hectoring' than usual. The police were also tagging their own tweets with the #sukey hashtag - info straight from the horse charge's mouth?</p><p>If Sukey does nothing else but force the Met to be more honest and informative on Twitter, and consider their tactics more carefully in the spotlight of (unsurprisingly suspicious, and potentially quite accurate) online publicity trying to guess them in advance, then that's a hell of an achievement right there. I suspect it can manage a bit more than that though... it will be interesting to see what they do next.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9410770">143</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9410770"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9410770"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9410770" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9410807"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/23/dennymeta/388cb979-f087-43bc-9a2a-dcf37d0793cb/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/dennymeta" title="User profile page">dennymeta</a> <p class="date">2 February 2011 9:21PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>Marshall: If that's what they want to happen, then the tactic of containment makes no sense whatsoever.

They infamously kettled the 2001 Mayday march and I've been witness to numerous other kettles over the years. And even that was only a revival of tactics they used during the miners' strikes and the Wapping demonstrations in the 80s. </p><p>Anyway, while Sukey may have had an impact on police tactics, it was very obvious that they were under orders to hold back. There were numerous opportunities to kettle people - first before anyone got to Millbank and definitely at the Egyptian embassy (it was well over an hour before anyone thought of leaving, more than enough time for the cops to close off the side streets). </p><p>To be honest, apart from in front of Millbank, most of the cops I encountered during the day were fairly chilled out, leading to some very funny scenes, like the three masked activists mimicing two cops running alongside the demo - http://twitpic.com/3uil0g and the point when the groups that headed off from the embassy towards Victoria Station decided to "kettle" three motorbike cops (http://twitpic.com/3ujks7 . </p><p>I've heard reports that things got a bit uglier when darkness fell, but I'd retired home by that point with a dead phone battery. </p><p>I've got a interesting analysis of how police tactics appear to be echoing tactics a decade ago developing in my head - get in touch if you'd like it as a piece for the Guardian or CiF.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9412364">17</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9412364"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9412364"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9412364" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9412383"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/23/Donnacha/1e180df4-1539-426e-8828-cbc62087b352/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/Donnacha" title="User profile page">Donnacha</a> <p class="date">2 February 2011 11:54PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>@Bluestone - if they try, I promise the NUJ will fight them all the way.

It seems to be an arbitrary and lawless state action against the people. Trapping people and denying them access to toilets, water and a way home seems to be an act of punishment rather than crowd control. Since the days of 'Maggi's Army', corruption in the 70s', charges of racism and wifully wrong prosections they have been working hard to recover the respect they had previously (if you go back far enough you'll find it). Decades of hard work could be lost over the coming months without skilful management of police tactics and behaviour by their leaders.</p><p>Surely they realise that a threatening aggressive stance will not pacify or subdue the spirit of people who think they have been wronged! They'll simply be associated with the wrong.</p><p>Ask some succesful classroom managers from problem schools for advice. Most of them will mention respect.

The fans were singing loudly and out of tune but causing no trouble. Passers-by were content to ignore them. They were completely unthreatening. However, when the police hear the words 'football supporter' a red mist descends.

However, the police's job is to stop protests that threaten the status quo, whether that it by kettling so that people's physical discomfort overrides their views, by dispersal so the the power of a mass of people together disintigrates, or by arrest and detention. So in a way, useful development that it is, Sukey is doing part of the police's job for them.</p><p>One of the most useful tactics of any protest is to turn the people who hold positions of implementing the law over to the protestors' side ie the police, army etc. That takes away most of the power of the dominant entity. The police, armed forces etc are people who earn low to medium salaries, and they and their families are also affected by all these public service cuts. One of the jobs of protestors is to convnce them that they are just like us, so should join in with the protest rather than defend people who are not like them. No job is worth it, especially one that will be cut in an instant. Maybe at the same time as alerting protestors, Sukey could include persuasive messages to the police to demotivate them.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9415230">4</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9415230"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9415230"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9415230" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9415542"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/Sacramento" title="User profile page">Sacramento</a> <p class="date">3 February 2011 9:45AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>I'm from Portugal, a country which has known democracy for only 36 years, and it<br/>always shocks me to read about police (government) tactics in demonstrations in England, a nation where democratic values are much more ingrained in the fabric of society.<br/>I find no reason for these tactics to exist except to intimidate and prevent people from demonstrating.

Thinking simplistically that the police are just law upholding public sector workers facing cuts is plain wrong. People are not randomly picked to be in the police FORCE (rebranding it a "service" fools no-one) and riot police are not randomly picked from within the police force. The potentially snarling, brutish and "upforit" frontline riot officer first chooses the force, and then chooses riot detail. Therefore the mentality of such a person is predetermined by such conditions and choices and should not be conveniently ignored. </p><p>2. Thinking of our current crop of protestors as light bringers and guardians of our democracy is also wrong. There are as many chinless over-priveliged feckless, or the "red or dead" disenfranchised and paranoid in their number as people with genuine ideological direction or pain. And of course there are amongst their number, rabble rousers and vandals a-plenty. When we have mass civil unrest with pensioners, workers, students the unemployed, oppressed Muslims, and former public sector workers standing together, the balance in the crowd will change significantly, and if Sukey helps then, all power to her elbow. </p><p>3. Speaking in general terms about either side is pointless, and thinking of them as sides at all and then taking one yourself is just plain idiotic.

It was very peaceful to begin with, but there were people there (usually wearing facemasks and carrying cider) who gave the impression that they were interested in violence and were shouting violent things. They are these types at many demonstrations.</p><p>The march had moved down towards Whitehall. Whilst there I was standing with a friend, a photo-journalist. I noticed these two men who came out of a side street. They suddenly ran into crowd, picked up some bollards and flung them into the crowd shouting loudly. This coincided with the riot police making their appearance. I watched the two men who ran off back down the side street and walked into a police monitoring area where they spoke to the officers. </p><p>I'm personally convinced they were plain clothes police and this was a tactic to provoke the crowd and allow them to them start their kettling action. Which is what happened next. I was then standing talking to someone later in the square and a policeman smashed me in the back with his shield. His colleague told him off for that I should hasten to say, and I did talk to some police who indicated that they were kettling in this way to ensure that the eventual dispersal would mean that the protests would finish by a specific time in the evening and not go on all night.</p><p>The kettling was an unpleasant experience, people needed the toilet. A female tourist who had got caught up in it has a young child in a pram and was really desparate to get out, but they wouldn't let her. This I found particularly disappointing. This isn't balanced policing, it is too harsh and inflexible.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9420920">2</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9420920"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9420920"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9420920" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9420985"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/Silelf" title="User profile page">Silelf</a> <p class="date">3 February 2011 2:13PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>the kids are allright no?

I was at the protest and subsequently in one of the smaller groups that broke off. We passed through Oxford Street, Covent Garden and Holborn and were met with riot vans full of officers on a few occasions. I don't recall people looking at their phones to figure out what to do when the TSG alighted from their vans or where to go but simply screaming at each other to run. </p><p>This comes from people paying greater attention to police tactics and learning how to avoid kettling (I came across <a href="http://anarchish.blogspot.com/2011/01/how-to-win-at-kettling-guide-for-non.html" rel="nofollow">this article</a> just before the protest and have read many others like it following the first couple of protests). That said, the police would've clearly blundered if they kettled people in areas like Oxford Street and Covent Garden on a Saturday afternoon, when it would be just as easy for passers-by to be caught up in the kettle as it would for protesters to claim they were simply passers-by.</p><p>In short, let's not give Sukey all the credit just yet.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9422158">0</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9422158"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9422158"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9422158" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9422468"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/22/pretzelberg/0dec9e3b-bc4f-41c6-b478-f5bd26242ea4/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/pretzelberg" title="User profile page">pretzelberg</a> <p class="date">3 February 2011 3:23PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <blockquote><p>something happened outside the Egyptian embassy that deserves at least a footnote in the annals of protest history.

I suspect those tactics are counter-productive serving only to alienate public sympathy and people holding your view are in the minority.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9424321">3</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9424321"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9424321"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9424321" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9426333"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/Wowbagger" title="User profile page">Wowbagger</a> <p class="date">3 February 2011 7:15PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>MarshallStack is actually Detective Constable Marshall Stack planted in Comment is Free, masquerading as a Guardian reader.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9426333">0</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9426333"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9426333"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9426333" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9427287"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/RolandRhett" title="User profile page">RolandRhett</a> <p class="date">3 February 2011 8:44PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <blockquote><p>vercoda<br/>3 February 2011 12:39AM<br/>The view from abroad?

As all the input/output data goes through these corporations, Sukey is actually inherently on the "open project" side of the camp because of this. The developers face a choice, say this up-front and try and use the activist/public backlash to widen the adoption of openness, or refocus on alt-tec and accept the probably crippling effect of moving into the shadow world of limited usability/effectiveness this brings with it.</p><p>Is there a middle path? Maybe trying to weather the storm of public backlash through making visible the corporate/police state we actually live in, and at the same time try to challenge it? Ideas?
