<div id="article-body-blocks"><p>What happened the last time you called into work sick?  A sympathetic  sentence from a  colleague, possibly. Some quality time alone with Cash in the Attic, certainly. In due course came re-entry, with the brackish waters of the office closing overhead as swiftly  as if you'd never left.</p><p>When <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/stevejobs" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Steve Jobs">Steve Jobs</a> announced last week that he would be spending some time away from <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/apple" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Apple">Apple</a>, he promptly <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/jan/17/apple-steve-jobs-leave" title="knocked 12.5bn off the value of his employer">knocked &#163;12.5bn off the value of his employer</a>. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/jan/17/apple-steve-jobs-medical-leave" title="News of his sick leave">News of his sick leave</a>  made front pages and even had Wall Street analysts bemoaning the loss  of a "genius".</p><p>Jobs has always been the best repackager in the technology industry. Over the past decade, he's alchemised the plain old MP3 player into the iPod, turned the corporate road warrior's mobile-email-browser-whatever into the iPhone and transformed the ugly tablet PC into the iPad. And last week, even as he took medical leave, the  Apple boss did it again, setting the seal on the transformation of the chief  executive into the figurehead of his own corporate cult.</p><p>The man <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/4242660/Steve-Jobs-Apples-iGod-Profile.html" title="business hacks call iGod">business hacks call iGod</a> has been playing this game for decades. Down the years photos show him in that unchanging Boomer outfit of black mock turtlenecks and stonewashed denim &#8212; instant recognisability in an anonymous industry. Then there are his gnomic utterances and the annual religious convention, the Macworld Expo in San Francisco, where Jobs regularly turns up to lay hands on his devotees. This is free advertising for a company that needs to flog its products by the millions, of course &#8211; but the cult also numbers Apple's own staffers. "It's Beatlemania," one former executive told the New Yorker in 1997 just as Jobs turned up on the company's Cupertino campus again, after 12 years away. The saviour was back.</p><p>True, before Jobs rejoined the fold, the question most commonly asked about the company he co-founded was how long it had left before making the corporate obituaries. Yet that doesn't make its turnaround solely the work  of one heavily stubbled mastermind, who saved a company through his  singular vision, taste and liberal use  of the i- prefix.</p><p>The messiah talk ignores the fact that Apple has around 46,600 full-time employees and another 3,000 temporary staff &#8211; including some of the best designers and marketers in the business. Far from being a semi-mystical software visionary, Jobs is a ruthless office  politician (during his long campaign to take back his company, reported the New Yorker in that 1997 article, one  Apple alumnus warned: "Steve is going to fuck Gil [Amelio, the former CEO]  so hard his eardrums will pop.") Nor does it take into account the way in which global supply chains minimise the role of any one individual, no  matter how powerful.</p><p>Take, for instance, the iPad: the  display panel is probably from a Korean contractor, the backlight will have been knocked up by a Taiwanese firm and the GPS is likely to have been made in Germany. Then there is the battery (Chinese, perhaps), the flash memory (which could well be from Japan's Toshiba) and the case (Taiwan, again).</p><p>Jobs is part of a widespread trend among chief executives to put themselves forward not as managers, but as leaders. Follow the coverage of the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/davos" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Davos">Davos</a> summit this week and count the number of times a corporate finance officer for some accounting-software company or other is described  as a business  leader. Elite MBA  programmes boast of how they will turn students into "change agents". As I type, the January 2007 cover of Harvard Business Review stares back at me. "The Tests of a Leader", it blares, under a photo of some shirt-sleeved young Turk doing push-ups on a boardroom table.</p><p>"Managers do things right, leaders see the right thing is done," said  Warren Bennis, founding father of Leadership studies. The implication was clear: a manager was good at painting by numbers, but a business leader was more akin to Turner.</p><p>The result has been a tremendous boost in chief-executive power, according to Dennis Tourish, an academic at Kent University. He points out that <a href="http://lea.sagepub.com/content/1/4/455.abstract" title="Enron just before it imploded was pretty much run like a cult">just before Enron imploded it was run like a cult</a>, with Jeff Skilling exercising huge control and influence over who was recruited, how they worked &#8211; and who got laid off. And while Enron was an exception, Tourish points out that Jack Welch as boss of General Electric had similar power. "Business leaders typically only have yes-men &#8211; no one to stand up to them."</p><p>In the end what the leadership talk appears to add up to is an alibi for bosses taking much more money out of the companies they run. There is John Thain who, even as he ran Merrill Lynch into the wall, demanded it pay <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-01-22/john-thains-87000-rug/" title="$1.2m to redecorate his office">$1.2m to redecorate his office</a>, including $35,000 for a "commode on legs". Then there is Mark Hurd, who ruled Hewlett-Packard with the iron law of pay for performance &#8211; until he was himself drummed out of office last  August for alleged corporate malfeasance and took a severance package of $34.6m. And for Team GB, we have Fred the Shred and his outsize pension, and BP's Tony Hayward receiving millions for his role in turning the Gulf oil spill from a tragedy into a farce.</p><p>Set against that lot, Jobs looks like an exemplar. But  he is really the best example  of an unhealthy trend.</p></div>

If you have worked with successful entrepreneurs you will appreciate that they are often not the most well-balanced or pleasant of people. But who cares - they are the ones that create private businesses which generate tax revenues and employment. They have big egos - what a surprise. Welcome what they do for the economy and ignore their egos.</p><p>You should start focusing on why Jobs and Wozniak created Apple in their garage in the USA, why Sergei Brin and Larry Page also created Google in their garage, why Zuckerberg created Facebook etc - and why there are so few of these stories in the UK or Europe. Step away from the net and you still find a huge amount of new ventures (eg in high tech) coming from the USA.<br/> <br/>Going forward private business is the only source of revenue (via corporation tax and income taxes on their employees) to pay for everything in this country. </p><p>When Asian economies are becoming leaders in high-tech industry, educate their young people far better than we do ours and pay their employees 5% of our wages without welfare you might find that manufacturing industry could be a rather painful destination to transition to.

I remember attending such events and having people tell me the most minute detail of Apple history on a regular basis. Apple is a company which attracts those people who like a bit of style, like things to work and above all like the old Apple saying "Think Different". The problem for Apple was that it has always pitched itself as swimming against the tide (when compared to Microsoft) and for a company like that you need a CEO who in the publics eyes is not boring. To date Steve Jobs is the ONLY person who has personified this.

You can buy cheaper hardware that does the same job, but doesn't look so pretty.That's the skill of Jobs, to tart it up in some nice boxes and sell it as a brand for lots more money than something that's more functional.

And Jobs didn't invent the Ipad you know.</p></blockquote><p>It's not "hero worship" it's just an acknowledgement that Jobs is valued at the right level. The writer of the article doesn't actually make any arguments for why the cult of the executive is bad, it's just vaguely sniffy about Jobs *because* he's a successful executive. It would be a very different matter if the article was levelled at the corporate system itself but it's not, it tries to dismantle the concept by attacking it's most successful example with no counter-examples and no real arguments! It attacks the phenomenon <b>on the phenomenon's own terms </b>and fails miserably, Jobs allegely isn't responsible for Apple's turnaround when it's blatantly apparent to anyone with two or more brain cells to rub together that Jobs is pretty much the canonical example of the positive value of unfied process under an individual. Would the article writer have preferred all those Apple employess working so very hard to have lost their employment? I suspect not.</p><p>I am no fan of Apple. I think their products are ridiculously overpriced, I think they encourage a mystification of technology that hampers rather than develops society and their users are almost universally weird - the vast majority don't seem ever to have used anything other than Apple products seem very genuinely to consider themselves experts in product comparison - proclaiming that Apple "just works". Ta-Daaaah! I've used Apple products and they DON'T just work. Their CD trays jam! The touch screens are a pain in the ass - 90% of the time you end up doing the wrong thing! I've used HP and Acer products and <b>they </b>DO work.</p><p>I completed an Angry Birds module once in one evening - all 15 levels. What else would I use an Apple product for? </p><p>A friend of mine (sysadmin, Sun micro expert) made the perfect observation of Apple products - "They do everything perfectly adequately."</p><p>But that's not how Apple consumers see it. And that's down to Jobs.</p><p>You may dislike this and think there's something slightly suspicious about it but you can't take him as an example of the detrimental or valueless effect of the cult of the executive <b>for the business the executive is running </b>as a replacement for the less hack-friendly position that people should buy cheaper computers and learn that better software than Apple releases is available everywhere for free or that putting a bit of effort into your own system yields rewards fifty times as valuable as owning a portable electric photo album, which is what I suspect the article writer thinks and is trying to lever into position behind a bunch of silly mop-waving...</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9297163">1</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9297163"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9297163"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9297163" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9297263"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/23/CorneliusTacitus/29d4fcdf-83fb-4bfc-91ca-151948aff67a/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/CorneliusTacitus" title="User profile page">CorneliusTacitus</a> <p class="date">25 January 2011 5:18PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>version1:</p><blockquote><p>The IP for designing and making the subassemblies now rests with the component manufactures.

Yes the iPod is an MP3 player, but the skill of Jobs+Ives etc was to redesign it in a manner that appealed to people and integrated it with the itunes store. Yes there may have been other cheaper gadgets around, but the fact remains that people bought the iPod in large numbers simply because of ease of use.

Apple added value to an otherwise mundane product; like it or not it's what they're good at.</p><blockquote><p>I wonder how much IP Apple actually has. But it must own the marketing rights and the brandname.</p></blockquote><p>I've no idea but they seem to face (and instigate) an awful lot of patent cases - doesn't neccessarily mean they're ripping people off since software patents are a minefield for everybody.</p><blockquote><p>the article makes good points but Jobs is a bad target. Particularily because he is a talented designer. And Jobs is the image people pay for. Sometimes life is like that.</p></blockquote><p>Agree on the first part but I doubt the increasing number of people in my University's Comp Sci Dept who are buying Macs, feel they are paying for the image. They're using them because of the Unix underpinnings to MacOSX...</p><p>@kurtsh:</p><p>If you feel the costs/benefits of developing for an Apple platform don't stack up, then develop for Android or WinPhone7.

Nor is his status as a "leader" at all mythical. He's not really a manager (Apple has people like Tim Cook to do that job), nor is he an inventor. (He's not a techie, and none of Apple's famous products were invented by him. In fact, according to Jef Raskin, the person who initiated and led the Macintosh project, he actually <i>obstructed</i> the project for the first two years, because he didn't understand it.) His only function at Apple has been to lead, and he has done this extraordinarily well. His own enthusiasm for his messianic "mission" to present the world with "insanely great" products really does create in Apple employees and customers mirroring enthusiasm, which translates into motivation and extreme brand loyalty.</p><p>Just because the cult of the leader exists, doesn't mean that the person portrayed as a leader is not one.</p><p>Incidentally, psychologists have found that successful corporate bosses and entrepreneurs often score high on one or more of three clinical scales:</p><p>OCPD (Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder) -- Perfectionist control freaks who work incredibly hard and are highly intolerant of people who don't follow their often whimsical and pernickety rules.<br/>NPD (Narcissistic Personality Disorder) -- Grandiose, self-important people who are convinced that their way is the only way, that whatever they are doing is of messianic importance, and everyone should follow, admire and agree with them, and anyone who doesn't is evil or at best a fool.<br/>APD (Antisocial Personality Disorder, a.k.a. psychopathy) -- People who lack empathy (but are able to hide this), and don't give a damn how anyone else feels as they tread on toes, crush heads, etc., in pursuit of their goals.</p><p>The reason people with these traits rise to the top is simple: <i>they get things done</i>.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9303760">2</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9303760"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9303760"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9303760" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9303789"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/22/1nn1t/2a7425cc-c81a-4e59-a90a-5580cd22335a/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/1nn1t" title="User profile page">1nn1t</a> <p class="date">26 January 2011 9:16AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <blockquote><p>meestersmeeth<br/>26 January 2011 6:57AM<br/>120 comments and the vast majority calling out he author for posting utter nonsense.

The <i>operating system</i>, is the thing that organizes storage for files and allocates resources to applications. Its shell is the interface it presents to users -- this could be a command line or a GUI. The pretty front end that you see on an iPhone is only the shell. Underneath, the operating system is FreeBSD.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9320303">1</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9320303"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9320303"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9320303" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9333514"> <li class="comment-author" id="end-of-comments"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/4to20numbers" title="User profile page">4to20numbers</a> <p class="date">28 January 2011 1:01AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>You don't understand, do you?</p><p>This is the Church of Apple, completely adored and venerated by the adoring host of the guardianship technocracy.</p><p>A classics degree, an Iphone and you know what, you sudden not only understand technology, but you can explain it to others.</p><p>Strange world we live in.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9333514">1</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9333514"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9333514"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9333514" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </div> </div>
