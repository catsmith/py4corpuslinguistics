<div id="article-body-blocks"><p>One of the glories of our print culture is the <em>Economist</em>, a magazine that combines eccentric, neoliberal editorial views with excellent, well-informed reporting. I have been a subscriber to it for more years than I care to remember and every weekend have tried to carve out the 90 minutes of undivided attention that it demands. It turns out that I am a perfectly normal customer in this respect.</p><p>In November 2009, I went to a talk given by Andrew Rashbass, CEO of the <em>Economist</em>, about the company's digital strategy. He related how he had commissioned research in a large number of countries into how subscribers in those territories used the publication. The message that came back was consistent: people who buy the <em>Economist</em> make a weekly "appointment" with the magazine – time that they set aside to read it. The conclusion: publications such as the <em>Economist</em> provide "immersive reading experiences", something that the web could not provide.</p><p>Under questioning, Rashbass was coy about what his digital strategy involved, but it was clear to all in the room that he was pinning his hopes on what was at the time a purely mythical product, the device that eventually materialised as the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/apple" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Apple">Apple</a> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/ipad" title="More from guardian.co.uk on iPad">iPad</a>.</p><p>Almost a year to the day year after Rashbass's talk, the <em>Economist</em> launched its iPad app. It's free, in the sense that anyone can download it. But to get it to download actual content (over and above a few free articles) you have to be an existing print subscriber or take out a digital subscription, which is almost as expensive. So this is a seriously walled garden. No surprises there: the <em>Economist</em> didn't get where it is today by giving away stuff for free.</p><p>The surprises start when you launch the app. Every Thursday, the "Read" button changes to "Download" and suddenly your iPad acquires the entire content of the current edition – in seconds. The second surprise is that it's easier and more pleasant to read than its printed counterpart and much nicer than the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/kindle" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Kindle">Kindle</a> edition of the magazine. The iPad has delivered a genuinely "immersive" reading experience. In part, this is a reflection on the device's screen technology and interface. But it's mainly down to the quality of the app's design.</p><p>So your columnist now has an unexpected problem: every Friday,  the postman delivers the print edition of the <em>Economist</em>. But the envelopes now sit unopened, gathering dust on the hall table. The upside is that I can share them with friends or donate them to a school, which is more than I can do with my walled-in digital edition, but that's another can of worms.</p><p>Coincidentally, another interesting app arrived on my iPad last week. Actually, it's a book in app's clothing. It's <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/david-eagleman" title="More from guardian.co.uk on David Eagleman">David Eagleman</a>'s <em>Why the Net Matters</em> (Canongate), an eight-chapter manifesto that seeks to explain the significance of the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/internet" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Internet">internet</a> for our future. As with the iPad edition of Stephen Fry's latest book, Eagleman's essay can be read non-sequentially. Each chapter splits the screen. On one side is conventional text. On the other are illustrations, photographs, animations and 3D models that the reader can manipulate. To see how it works, he's made <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIpZ6l0KEes" title="">a YouTube video</a>. It's clever, informative, intriguing and fresh.</p><p>These two developments – the <em>Economist's</em> app and Eagleman's "book" – ought to serve as a wake-up call for the print <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/publishing" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Publishing">publishing</a> industry. The success of Amazon's Kindle has, I think, lulled print publishers into a false sense of security. After all, they're thinking, the stuff that goes on the Kindle is just text. It may not be created by squeezing dyes on to processed wood-pulp, but it's still text. And that's something we're good at. So no need to panic. Amazon may be a pain to deal with, but the Kindle and its ilk will see us through.</p><p>If that's really what publishers are thinking, then they're in for some nasty surprises. The concept of a "book" will change under the pressure of iPad-type devices, just as concepts of what constitutes a magazine or a news<em>paper</em> are already changing. This doesn't mean that paper publications will go away. But it does mean that print publishers who wish to thrive in the new environment will not just have to learn new tricks but will also have to tool up. In particular, they will have to add serious in-house technological competencies to their publishing skills.</p><p>If they don't do it, then someone else will. There will always be "books". The question now is: will there always be publishers?</p></div>

Totally. The Kindle is disappointing and doesn't allow for controlled art direction: you get the text, but not the design, and not the mood. There are some brilliant magazines and books out there but their Kindle versions miss the point, because the look and feel aren't included. The iPad allows the creator to control the experience, keep the creative vision, and the reader's experience is enhanced as a result. I don't know why anyone would buy the Kindle as a device: it's a good app on the iPad (and I use it as such for buying text-only books), but it's not worth buying as a piece of hardware.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-8866496">10</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/8866496"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-8866496" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/8866496" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-8866668"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/DavidGiant" title="User profile page">DavidGiant</a> <p class="date">19 December 2010 4:27AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>There is a difference between a book and a magazine. In the magazine world there are a number of fantastic print magazines who are way ahead of you. Take Wired for example. They have translated a fantastic print product and improved it to make an iPad application. No problems transitioning here.</p><p>Magazines which are graphic or media based either already do this or are on their way to doing this and its for a good reason. It makes consuming their articles more fun.</p><p>However... there are many many examples which would fail on this platform. Practically any novel. I mean... I don't want an interactive novel. I tried that, they exist in paper form. I made a choice, turned to page 97 and the protagonist died. With the majority of text books you use your brain in some way to visualise what you are reading. If you do not want to do this you watch a film of the book, a documentary about some real event or a youtube/podcast series to learn something.</p><p>Interactive media has its roll, especially in the magazine / newspaper industries. It already has. However the publishing industry is multi-faceted. A sector will change.

The simple fact is, we enter the same act (reading) with a different mind-set depending upon the content (fiction, non-fiction; book, magazine). It's the same when we watch TV or listen to the radio: the act is the same, the approach varies - you pay more attention when listening to a radio play or quiz than when you have music on; you watch a documentary in a different way/mindset than a film, and that's different again from watching a comedy sketch show.<br/>'Interactive novels' would annoy the hell out of me, tbh. If I'm involved in the story, any images, etc, would destroy the suspension of disbelief that is required for works of fiction to succeed. It'd be the equivalent of putting text on screen during, say, Avatar reading 'You know this stuff isn't real, don't you? Outside, it's raining and the 5.15 train has been cancelled'.<br/>In works of fiction, then...no. Unless you have them up front, like videos used to have an 'Upcoming Attractions' showreel before the actual film, or leave them until the end. It'd be an ideal way for publishers to suggest other authors in the genre, other books they have out in different genres, and past works (if any) of the author people have just read, as well as providing additional content. <br/>IMO, most readers would accept images, Wikilinks, bios, etc provided they were additional material and did not intrude upon the story itself.<br/>Interactive content for (some) magazines and newspapers seems like a good idea, though, and could provide alternative revenue streams (possibly). Advertisers, for example, could arrange for video content to be included, or indeed the same 'space' could be used for multiple 'static' ads in a similar way to the digital hoardings in some football grounds. (I guess the front and end pages of fiction books could do the same thing, introducing another possible revenue stream to publishers and perhaps allowing them to reduce the cost of ebooks/book apps).</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-8868743">2</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/8868743"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-8868743" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/8868743" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-8869225"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/23/unf0lded/258c94aa-b52f-42a5-b5ca-94e80eb2a203/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/unf0lded" title="User profile page">unf0lded</a> <p class="date">19 December 2010 12:33PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>Many great points!

No, I'm afraid it's not. Reading a book is more than just scanning words that assemble themselves into a sentence that conveys the thoughts and ideas of the writer. When you read a book, you're physically engaging with a medium that has been around a hell of a lot longer than computers. You can't compare the printed word with the electronic. It's impossible. Oooh, it's backlit. So? When I think it's not bright enough to read I turn on a light. There is nothing comparable in either the Apple store, etc, to going into a bookshop - say, Shakespeare and Co in Paris - and having the <i>smell</i> of old books hit you, or that chemical whiff that comes out of a new textbook, or the texture of paper under your fingertips. There ain't an app for that. iPad and Kindle devotees might claim that they're seeing the way of the future. I doubt that. Yes, you could probably revolutionise the newspaper and magazine markets, but not much else. Ultimately, why waste your time and energy downloading books when you don't even own a physical copy? And besides, who's to say that the format these books come in right now won't change in the next three, five years and you have to potentially replace them or convert them all to the new format? Exactly. With a book, you don't have that worry.</p><p>Keep the iPads and Kindles for yourselves. I'd rather actually <i>read</i> a book, rather than scan a facsimile. And besides, when I want to throw a book across the room, at least I'm not running the risk of destroying hundreds of pounds of penis replacement from Mr Jobs, am I?</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-8874995">9</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/8874995"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-8874995" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/8874995" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-8876100"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/09/08/gooogle/c52dac19-35df-4dac-83b4-aef7d8f490d6/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/gooogle" title="User profile page">gooogle</a> <p class="date">20 December 2010 8:14AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>It "doesn't mean that paper publications will go away?"

This article didn't quite reach the bar, though I'm grateful for the David Eagleman link.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-8885461">0</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/8885461"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-8885461" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/8885461" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-8887876"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/stephenpublisher" title="User profile page">stephenpublisher</a> <p class="date">20 December 2010 10:58PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>AS ever some of what is being said here is intelligent, some extraordinary in its prejudice and plain ignorance of what is actually going on in print publishing. Sure there are pockets of inactivity but many publishers are investing heavily in digital developments for, among others, the iPad. I found Naughton's article tedious - how many times have we had to read "is this the end of publishers?" Who cares? If publishers figure out a usual role that makes money for rights holders by giving readers (we are still talking about books and reading) books/products they find useful, then they'll continue to exist. Some will survive, some won't. It really is a dull debate. Publishing isn't going to go away, who the successful publishers will be is perhaps more interesting.</p><p>However, one reason publishers "shamefully" aren't able to bring forward new apps etc (this in defence of Thames and Hudson and other art book publishers for example) is that they can't get the rights to reproduce the artworks. They'd do it if they could.</p><p>Secondly, 2011 will be the first year in which publishers, including the likes of DK, will regularly bring out digital product. This may seem slow, but I'm sure if publishers had rushed with weak product the charge would have been of incompetence. Publishers are making a transition from print to multi-platform and it will take time. But to make a judgement of how they are making that transition on the basis of the early days of tablet computing would be a mistake in my view.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-8887876">0</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/8887876"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-8887876" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/8887876" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-8890544"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/MonkeySpunkMoped" title="User profile page">MonkeySpunkMoped</a> <p class="date">21 December 2010 9:02AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>throughaglassdarkly,</p><p>You need to check your dictionary.

Surely each of the publishers we've mentioned has at least three titles that it currently has in print, owns all the content rights to and could have published book apps from. As regards development, I think they've had enough time this year to do this and to produce excellent book apps. </p><p>The strength of my criticism is fuelled by the performance of Apple. They just move so fast and do things so well. The iPad opens up huge opportunities for publishing, as we agree. But here we are at Christmas, surely a big market for the publishers of 'coffee table' books, and I can't find anything to buy from the big guns to give to my mother to read and look at on her iPad. I think that they've performed very sluggishly.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-8895206">0</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/8895206"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-8895206" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/8895206" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-8898670"> <li class="comment-author" id="end-of-comments"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/Fleetstreet" title="User profile page">Fleetstreet</a> <p class="date">21 December 2010 5:08PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <blockquote><p>The second surprise is that it's easier and more pleasant to read than its printed counterpart and much nicer than the Kindle edition of the magazine. </p></blockquote><p>It would be nice of you to more fully describe how you came to that statement, as it is the basis for our whole argument.
