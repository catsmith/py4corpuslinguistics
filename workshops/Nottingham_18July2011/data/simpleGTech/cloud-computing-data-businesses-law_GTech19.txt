<div id="article-body-blocks"><p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/02/17/interview_with_google_enterprise_boss_david_girouard/" title="">According to Google</a> the future is in the cloud &#8211; soon we may all have information about us kept there, wherever "there" is. Organisations no longer have to store data, including personal data, on their own servers in their own premises; economies of scale coupled with relatively straightforward technology mean that if there is storage space available for the data I control and process over there, somewhere, I can store it over there, using space on a server that would otherwise be left empty.</p><p>Very simply, that is what the "cloud" is and enables. It is not (yet) any server that we can use to store our data, but any server that is opened up to us, under a cloud <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/computing" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Computing">computing</a> agreement. And the cost saving, inevitably, is very attractive to the company whose data storage needs exceed its ability, or willingness, to invest in ever bigger data storage for sole use.</p><p>The data security implications have been a cause for concern in the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/eu" title="More from guardian.co.uk on European Union">European Union</a>, which is involved in regulating the way our private information is handled. Data protection law requires businesses to protect personal data from unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction and damage. In addition, personal data must not be transferred outside the European Economic Area unless it goes to a country that has adequate protection for the rights and freedoms of individuals in relation to the way it is processed and stored.</p><p>The challenge presented by the cloud is that these simple statements are out of date. I don't actually know where I am storing data in the cloud. All I know is that when I need it, it's available to me. It is being stored somewhere out there where storage is cheap, or where there is available storage space. I could make the scenario more complex &#8211; I collect data in the UK, store it in Portugal, and share it with my Danish subsidiary. Or to add greater complexity &#8211; I store it (let's think topically), it turns out, partly in Egypt, through my cloud storage supplier.</p><p>And as a data subject (the person about whom the data relates), while I might have some legal redress if the data about me leaks, what I really want to know is that when I give it to you to look after, you're not going to scatter it to the corners of the world for everyone to see. Businesses face a number of potentially conflicting pressures: to cut costs and to achieve the full benefits of technology on the one hand and on the other, to ensure that personal data is kept safe and complies with the law.</p><p><a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/ebook/ebook.htm" title="">Guidance</a> produced by the UK <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/information-commissioner" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Information commissioner">Information Commissioner</a>'s Office last July warns that organisations using <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/cloud-computing" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Cloud computing">cloud computing</a> must not relinquish control of the personal data they collect or expose it to security risks that wouldn't have arisen if it had been kept in the UK. The ICO guidance says there must be a written contract in place to require the web service provider to follow instructions from the business using it and to have equivalent security in place. It also says it is good practice to encrypt data before it is transferred to protect it from hackers.</p><p>European digital agenda commissioner, Neelie Kroes, has urged those building clouds to include appropriate levels of data security in their services. At the same time, the EU is in the process of reviewing the general legal framework for the protection of personal data (with a view to proposing a new directive this year) and is looking to release a cloud computing strategy document in 2012. Where those issues land over the next 12 months should determine how we lawfully handle data for the next decade. In the meantime, it's a moving target.</p><p><em>Adam Rose is a partner at Berwin Leighton Paisner and specialises in outsourcing and information technology matters</em></p></div>

The fact it could be anywhere and over time physically moves may make it less vulnerable to attack and possibly reduces the scope for making connections between diverse sets of personal data.</p><p>If all my stuff is scattered across a variety of clouds and cloud providers (it isn't but that's my problem), the scope for merging it into a very detailed account of everything I do may be constrained. The threat to personal security typically arises from aggregating data, which may be more difficult in the cloud. So the concern about the cloud that we don't know what is going on with our data may be as much a part of the solution as the problem.</p><p>In business management and accounting terms it may be problematic that we do not know where our data currently sits (if that is such an utterance has any meaning in the cloud when it could be striped across multiple installations) but for security it may be an advantage. Most computer security works on the basis of using codes which are difficult to crack, if the cloud makes data sets more difficult to find and connect it is more secure.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9674878">2</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9674878"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9674878"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9674878" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9675223"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/23/MarvinThePA/b38fd7f5-5299-40af-b034-a17259e35997/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/MarvinThePA" title="User profile page">MarvinThePA</a> <p class="date">22 February 2011 11:24AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <blockquote><p>Most computer security works on the basis of using codes which are difficult to crack, if the cloud makes data sets more difficult to find and connect it is more secure.</p></blockquote><p>I think there is another point that the major security issues are not over access to repositories of data (your own or in the cloud) -- which can be reasonably well- secured if you put a bit of effort into appropriate physical security, procedures, and the right software.</p><p>Vulnerability is always at the receiving end, keylogging, printouts, crappy personal passwords [<b>or needlessly complex password systems that force people to write down unmemorisable strings of nums and letters on Post-its and stick them to their screen</b>] , wi-fi hacking, and putting army personnel lists on a DVD to take home etc etc..

It's just the latest buzzword for externally-hosted IT services - either on a vendor's infrastructure or a private infrastructure - and does not mean a distributed universal computing system. The data is still, to all intents and purposes, siloed. All of those 'dozen or so companies' will be buying their own cloud services, and will not necessarily be sharing data anymore than they do already.

This network can also be access by the students as a virtual drive to store portfolios etc etc.</p><p>All good stuff -- but, I want access to all my data, not just the stuff I create specifically for school. The only practical way to do this was 8Gb+ USB memory. As they are now effectively banned, I've turned to the cloud in the shape of DropBox. Now, I don't care where this data is actually stored - after all a copy is on my PC at home, just the fact that it actually works and I can access my data from ANYWHERE.</p><p>Using the cloud is not the issue -- from experience my DropBox account is more stable than the school network, more accessible and faster. </p><p>Would I trust DropBox with confidential personal data --- probably not.
