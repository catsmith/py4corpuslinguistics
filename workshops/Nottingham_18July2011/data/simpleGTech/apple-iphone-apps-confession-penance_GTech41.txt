Photograph: David Turnley/Corbis</div></div>
<div id="article-body-blocks"><p>So the Catholic church has approved its first iPhone app. Taking it's lead from last year's <a href="http://bit.ly/dSQKaD" title="Vatican: World Communications Day papal address">World Communications Day papal address</a>, in which Catholics were called on to embrace the potential of the internet, developer <a href="http://www.littleiapps.com/overview.php" title="Little iApps">Little iApps</a> has released a program it claims is "the perfect aid for every penitent". Featuring a "step-by-step guide to the sacrament", <a href="http://bit.ly/dOkqqX" title="Guardian: Confession? There's an app for that">Confession: A Roman Catholic App</a> invites Catholics to "prayerfully prepare for and participate in the Rite of Penance".</p><p>It may well also appeal to many non-Catholics, to whom the act of confession can sound rather intriguing, like a cross between ringing the Samaritans and jumping into a magical guilt-alleviating power shower. There's even some evidence that opening up in confession can have positive physical effects: one 1986 study at Dallas' Southern Methodist University found that those encouraged to take part in regular "self-reflective venting of emotions" experienced fewer health problems than a control group.</p><p>Could apps like Confession give non-Catholics a commitment-free insight into what the sacrament is really like? While Confession does come with the <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/consumer/story/2011/02/08/technology-confession-app-catholic-church.html" title="CBC: Confession app blessed by Catholic bishop">official blessing</a> of Indiana Bishop Kevin C Rhoades, the church has been quick to emphasise that it's not a substitute for the real thing. Vatican spokesman <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/02/10/vatican.confession.app/index.html" title="CNN: Vatican warns about iPhone Confession app">Federico Lombardi said</a>: "It is essential to understand well the sacrament of penitence requires the personal dialogue between the penitent and the confessor and the absolution by the confessor. This cannot in any way be substituted by a technology application."</p><p>However, another iPhone app, albeit one without Vatican approval, is aiming to do just that. <a href="http://www.freshapps.com/penance/" title="Penance">Penance</a> is seeking to use the sacrament as a jumping off point for establishing an online community full of sinners anonymously confessing their hearts out to one another. Developer <a href="http://www.thenigerianvoice.com/nvnews/41205/1/oh-come-all-ye-sinful-confess-in-confidence-to-you.html" title="The Nigerian Voice: Oh come all ye sinful! Confess in confidence. to your iPhone">Hasham Abbas says</a>: "With churchgoing at an all-time low, and the digital age leaving us disconnected from our families and communities, few have an outlet for healthy confession. So it made sense to give people a virtual confession booth where they can unload whatever has been troubling their conscience."</p><p>Prior to the Catholic church's endorsement of the Confession app, some had expressed offence at the very idea of co-opting the language and imagery of the confessional to sell to iPhone users. One <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/penance/id405492979?mt=8" title="iTunes Preview: Penance">reviewer</a> of Penance said: "This app belittles the sacrament of reconciliation, twisting it from a tender act of love and forgiveness, into a salacious game where sinning is encouraged, and shame is mocked. This is anti-Catholic bigotry, pure and simple. Can you imagine an app that mocked Moslems or Jews this way?"</p><p>While Confession seems to be little more than an oddly conceived effort to encourage more Catholics to return to the sacrament, Penance is much more like the conventional internet: anyone who might be tempted to approach this virtual confessional in a serious manner ought to prepare themselves for the bawdiness, bad language and troll-like behaviour that's part and parcel of pretty much any online community with low barriers to membership.</p><p>According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, "the regular confession of our venial sins helps us form our conscience, fight against evil tendencies, let ourselves be healed by Christ and progress in the life of the Spirit &#8230; The beginning of good works is the confession of evil works." But whether or not you're using an iPhone to help unburden yourself, it's a good idea to have some idea of exactly who it is you're confessing to.</p></div>

Can&#8217;t sins be forgiven with out it?</p></blockquote><p>The only sins which need to be confessed are mortal sins. These are particularly serious acts of radical selfishness which rupture the close relationship between the individual and God. Or to put it another way mortal sin kills grace in the soul. When an individual realises that their actions have brought about this rupture, experiences a strong desire to remedy that situation and forms an intention not to commit similar acts again then they are urged to attend what is now known as the sacrament of reconciliation. </p><p>Christianity is an incarnated faith, God became man thus making human actions, word, emotions and the like a part of divine nature, God became part of a family and part of a community thus making these part of the divine story too. So sin involves the whole person and reconciliation involves the whole person and those around them. The Protestant notion that an individual saying to God "Jesus I am sorry" is an adequate sign of repentance is not comprehensively true. The word repentance is from the word metanoia which means a transformation of mind, a complete change in a human person such a change must have a manifestation in the entire person. If you say "Jesus I am sorry" and then die then fine you are forgiven. If you say "Jesus I am sorry", live for another 60 years and do nothing else to repair the beach then your response doesn't really meet the situation. Confession is about more than words.</p><blockquote><p>But as I understand, in Catholicism you effectively have a point in your life taken as the reference for auditing your soul &#8211; usually the moment you die</p></blockquote><p>After you die its a done deal. What happens at the point of death is a matter of speculation, in areas where the Church has not pronounced definitively individuals are free to speculate. Some like St Catherine of Siena believe that at the very moment of death individuals get one last chance to opt for loving union with God. Only those who want to be damned actually get damned.</p><p> </p><blockquote><p>why don&#8217;t catholics go to confession more often?</p></blockquote><p>A question Pope John Paul II often asked. It is really only first world Catholics who have a problem with confession and that says more about the first world than about Catholicism.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9540231">7</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9540231"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9540231"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9540231" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9540900"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/CSlater" title="User profile page">CSlater</a> <p class="date">11 February 2011 6:11PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>Me: Forgive me Father for I have sinned.

Protestants point to the example of the good thief on the cross repenting and then going to heaven without doing anything else. Fair enough, it can happen. If however the man had been taken down from the cross in Life of Brian mode and went on to live another 30 or 40 years then some manifestation of his metanoia would have to show up in how he lived his life.

Is it too painful?</p></blockquote><p>I think it may have something to do with a loss of a sense of the seriousness of sin and the sense of personal responsibility. We do bad stuff and then convince ourselves that it wasn't that bad and anyway it wasn't us to blame, society made us do it, stress made us do it, unreasonable people made us do it, whatever. Admitting we have no one to blame but ourselves and that we are capable of deliberately doing bad stuff goes totally against the grain of Western thinking and practice.</p><blockquote><p>It was a waste of time to be honest because he usual just asked stupid questions and try make me feel good about myself.</p></blockquote><p>It is good to be affirmed and it is good to be challenged. The doctrine of the Cross affirms that you are somebody so lovable that Jesus was willing to die a terrible death for you. And it challenges you because your actions contributed to that Passion. By His stripes we are healed.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9546506">8</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9546506"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9546506"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9546506" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9548793"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2011/03/27/patrickfowke/7df83826-d9f9-478b-a073-b3555712f916/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/patrickfowke" title="User profile page">patrickfowke</a> <p class="date">12 February 2011 1:55PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>StevHep <br/></p><blockquote><p><br/>Protestants point to the example of the good thief on the cross repenting and then going to heaven without doing anything else.

Plus wanting to be "saved" is about embarking on a wonderful journey with God that truly begins once one accept Christ as Lord, Friend and Saviour. </p><p>He can save even the most wretched of sinners. </p><p>At end of day, key to God's salvation is that man loves God and neighbour - love. Love is about recognizing - as so many Prot. reformers correctly point out - that love on man's part is about recognizing that WITHOUT God, it's all useless. But where some of them seem to go wrong is to suggest that God does everything and we do nothing. God does 99.99% of it. But effort is required on our part, too. We are required to CHOOSE God. To TRUST in God. To PRAY to God. And DO things for God (i.e. be a channel of His love towards others). This all takes EFFORT on our part. </p><p>God is so focused on our salvation - that every hair on our head is counted as it says in the Bible. In other words, everything we do and every action and thought in our heads, God works to maximize our opportunities for salvation (it might not seem like that at the time but in the long-term). So often sin and evil (sin and evil of others, not just ourselves) gets in the way, God still carries on with "every hair on our head is counted" (he doesn't go off and have breaks, day-dream, loses focus on the big picture, or whatever, unlike us). </p><p>The fact that He humilated Himself to become man, die on the cross on so on, is the Example Supreme of the lengths God goes for our salvation. God didn't need to become man or die on the Cross for His sake (absoluetely not at all). He did it purely for our sakes only. God took no pleasure in being humilated and murdered on a Cross. He did it for us - for our well-being and salvation, only. And one of the most important things of the Cross is that he died in order to make up for the shortfall of evil / sin that we are guilty of and cannot make up for / redeem by oursleves. But that we must, in some profound way, take up our own crosses in order to demonstrate that we believe and trust in, and love, God, and that we want to be saved, and that we want others to be saved as well. Of course, the irony of taking up the cross, is the crosses God gives us are light - in the sense that so often he fills those who suffer with a spiritual kind of peace and joy - a kind of peace and joy that one cannot experience by one's own efforts only.</p><p>Christ really is good. And He should be lauded for being great (his humility has <b>great</b> consequences for us, whilst at the same time He doesn't look for greatness for himself).</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9548793">1</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9548793"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9548793"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9548793" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9548816"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2011/03/27/patrickfowke/7df83826-d9f9-478b-a073-b3555712f916/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/patrickfowke" title="User profile page">patrickfowke</a> <p class="date">12 February 2011 2:00PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <blockquote><p>in the sense that so often he fills those who suffer with a spiritual kind of peace and joy - a kind of peace and joy that one cannot experience by one's own efforts only.</p></blockquote><p>- Not forgetting that when people respond to conscience - whoever they are - they're responding to God within them, in other words they're responding to God, and God is helping them to carrying out their conscience, even if they are not aware at the time or in general that God is behind all of this.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9548816">0</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9548816"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9548816"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9548816" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9548895"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2011/03/27/patrickfowke/7df83826-d9f9-478b-a073-b3555712f916/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/patrickfowke" title="User profile page">patrickfowke</a> <p class="date">12 February 2011 2:13PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <blockquote><p>Why do Catholics have confession? Can&#8217;t sins be forgiven with out it?</p></blockquote><p>- To add to Steve's points on this (not detract from), there is, also, the element of "going to the shrink" involved in confession. The priest may or not be a trained pyschologist, doesn't matter (and often professional pyschologists are required in assistance to confession - but in matters related to the brain and traumatic experiences and so on as opposed to matters relating to the sin of an individual) but so much of "ordinary" people's pyschological's problems in life are to do with guilt. Confession isn't about: get rid of your guilt and go and sin again. But rather, feel genuine shame for what you've done, try and do something to make up for what you've done (and if you've broken the law, go to the police), but at same time, God will forgive you for - if you ask for it and are genuine about it. He wants to forgive you as soon as possible so that you will go on to do good instead of bad, to prevent the guilt in you holding you back from doing good. At same time, a genuine confession will show you how harmful your sins have been to you in order to refrain you from doing bad, again.<br/>Confession is a bit like going to the dentist, as well. It can be an uncomfortable experience at the time. But you just get on with it (as well as reflecting about it) at a certain point. Because you know that in the long term it is good for you (and others - i.e. the positive effects of confessions will have positive effects on those around you). </p><p>Confession, the Church, Christianity in general, and so on is about <b>HAPPINESS</b>. But in order to be truly happy, we often have to uncover some uncomfortable truths about ourselves (daily, as well as in Mass and confession, and so on).</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9548895">1</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9548895"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9548895"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9548895" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9549040"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2011/03/19/Fiction/7b5a54fb-cc8f-4ed1-b7f2-c68ca4a8ccbf/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/Fiction" title="User profile page">Fiction</a> <p class="date">12 February 2011 2:38PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>@patrickfowke<br/></p><blockquote><p>Confession, the Church, Christianity in general, and so on is about HAPPINESS.</p></blockquote><p><br/>They've got a funny way of showing it...</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9549040">0</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9549040"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9549040"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9549040" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9549169"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2011/03/27/patrickfowke/7df83826-d9f9-478b-a073-b3555712f916/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/patrickfowke" title="User profile page">patrickfowke</a> <p class="date">12 February 2011 3:01PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>Fiction </p><blockquote><p>Confession, the Church, Christianity in general, and so on is about HAPPINESS.</p><p>They've got a funny way of showing it...</p></blockquote><p>- Who is they, exactly ?!</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9549169">0</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9549169"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9549169"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9549169" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9549868"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2011/03/19/Fiction/7b5a54fb-cc8f-4ed1-b7f2-c68ca4a8ccbf/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/Fiction" title="User profile page">Fiction</a> <p class="date">12 February 2011 4:37PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>@patrickfowke<br/></p><blockquote><p>Who is they, exactly ?!</p></blockquote><p><br/>The Christian churches.

A most courteous and thought-provoking response from you. Unfortunately, I can't cite the original published source of the article on pomegrantes/apples, as I seem to have filed it away somewhere under "various" (I studied botany, but not as my "major subject). The "pomegranate theory" does have its merits, however, if one could accept the climatic and environmental conditions as may have been predominant in Mesopotamia, so many ages ago. Theologians may certainly not have taken a "line" on the taxonomy of any particular "flowers, fruits etc," but they have certainly been quick off the mark when it comes to the by-products of certain plant species: "wheat", chaff", "tares", and other such have been widely used for indoctrination purposes over the past two millenia. "Let a hundred flowers blossom" is a truly lovely statement, but does it include the pathogens which could affect those flowers as well ?. </p><p>Fiction (12/02/2011 - 10:12 pm).

James 5:16 says "confess your sins to one another" but the forgiveness comes direct from our one mediator.</p></blockquote><p>Exactly what the Catholic Church teaches. Perhaps rather than repeating what your teachers taught you you might like to do some primary research. The relevant section in the Catechism is <a href="http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s2c2a4.htm" rel="nofollow">THE SACRAMENT OF PENANCE AND RECONCILIATION</a>. Amongst other things it says-</p><p><i>1443 During his public life Jesus not only forgave sins, but also made plain the effect of this forgiveness: he reintegrated forgiven sinners into the community of the People of God from which sin had alienated or even excluded them. A remarkable sign of this is the fact that Jesus receives sinners at his table, a gesture that expresses in an astonishing way both God's forgiveness and the return to the bosom of the People of God.</i></p><p><i>1444 In imparting to his apostles his own power to forgive sins the Lord also gives them the authority to reconcile sinners with the Church. This ecclesial dimension of their task is expressed most notably in Christ's solemn words to Simon Peter: "I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."45 "The office of binding and loosing which was given to Peter was also assigned to the college of the apostles united to its head."</i></p><p><i>1445 The words bind and loose mean: whomever you exclude from your communion, will be excluded from communion with God; whomever you receive anew into your communion, God will welcome back into his. Reconciliation with the Church is inseparable from reconciliation with God.</i></p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9557349">2</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9557349"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9557349"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9557349" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9557488"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2011/03/19/Fiction/7b5a54fb-cc8f-4ed1-b7f2-c68ca4a8ccbf/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/Fiction" title="User profile page">Fiction</a> <p class="date">13 February 2011 1:15PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>@DocDave<br/></p><blockquote><p>The "fact" of the matter is that you may not have been reading up as closely as you should on the freely-available PR handouts</p></blockquote><p><br/>Exactly.
