<div id="article-body-blocks"><p>Once upon a time, when <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/apple" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Apple">Apple</a> was mainly a computer manufacturer, people used to liken it to BMW. That was because it made expensive, nicely designed products for a niche market made up of affluent, design-conscious customers who also served as enthusiastic – nay fanatical – evangelists for the brand. It was seen as innovative and quirky but not part of the industry's mainstream, which was dominated by Microsoft and the companies making the PCs that ran Windows software. This view of Apple was summed up by <a href="http://www.commodore.ca/history/people/1989_you_dont_know_jack.htm" title="">Jack Tramiel</a>, the boss of Commodore, when <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/stevejobs" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Steve Jobs">Steve Jobs</a> first showed him the Macintosh computer. "Very nice, Steve," growled Tramiel. "I guess you'll sell it in boutiques."</p><p>That was a long time ago. Now, with a market capitalisation of just over $331bn, Apple is the second most valuable company in the world – bigger than Microsoft ($220bn), Oracle ($167bn) or Google ($196bn). The quirky little computer company has grown into a giant. But not necessarily a giant of the Big Friendly variety, as the world's magazine publishers have recently discovered and as the music and software industries have known for some time. For Apple now controls the commanding heights of the online content business and it looks like doing the same to the mobile phone business. At the moment, it looks as though nobody has a good idea of how to stop it.</p><p>Every year, <em>Fortune </em>magazine polls a sample of US CEOs asking for their opinions of their competitors. The results for 2011 have just been released and they show that <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/030311-apple-google-admired-fortune.html" title="">Apple is the "most admired" company</a> in America. This is the sixth year in a row that it has held that title.</p><p>The reasons are obvious. On the product side, Apple creates beautifully designed, highly functional and user-friendly devices that delight customers and provide fat profit margins; it has a corporate culture that reliably delivers these products by specified dates; it's much more innovative than any of its competitors; and it has a unique mastery of both hardware and software.</p><p>On the strategic side, the company has displayed a deep understanding of technology and a shrewd appreciation of potential devices and services for which people will pay over the odds. Most CEOs would kill to run a company that possessed a quarter of these competencies. Apple appears to have them all. Its current dominance is built on three big ideas. The first is that design really matters. It's not something you can outsource to a design consultancy – which is what most companies do – and design is as much about ease of use as it is about aesthetics. The second insight was that the maelstrom of illicit music downloading triggered by Napster couldn't last and that the first company to offer a simple way of legally purchasing music (and, later, other kinds of content) online would clean up. And third – and most important – there was the insight that mobile phones are really just hand-held computers that happen to make voice calls and that it's the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/computing" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Computing">computing</a> bit that really matters.</p><p>Most of the media commentary about Apple attributes all of these insights to<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-20/apple-after-steve-jobs-less-charismatic-more-corporate-commentary.html" title=""> Steve Jobs, the company's charismatic co-founder</a>, on the grounds that Apple's renaissance began when he returned to the company in 1996.</p><p>This may well be true, though it seems unlikely that such a comprehensive corporate recovery could be the work of a single individual, no matter how charismatic. What's more plausible is that Apple's corporate culture took on some of the characteristics of its CEO's personality, much as Microsoft was once a corporate extension of Bill Gates, with all that implied in terms of aggression and drive.</p><p>Whatever the explanation, the fact is that Apple now has a dominant position in several key businesses (content distribution and mobile computing) and is having a seriously disruptive impact on the mobile phone industry. In particular, its iTunes Store gives it control of the tollgate through which billions of paid-for music tracks and albums, videos and apps cascade down to millions of customers worldwide. It levies a commission on everything that passes through that gate. And every Apple mobile device sold can only be activated by hooking up to the gate.</p><p></p><p></p><p>This gives Apple unparalleled power. Lots of other organisations offer paid-for downloads, but none has the credit card details of so many internet users who are accustomed to paying for stuff online. This was one reason why proprietors of print magazines began to slaver when the iPad appeared. Here at last was a way of getting people to pay for online content: just make it available on iTunes and let Apple collect the money. Sure, it rankled that Apple took 30%, but – hey – at least it would bring to an end the parasitic free riding that was endemic on the web. Henceforth, the web was dead: publishing magazines as iPad apps was the future.</p><p>Then Apple abruptly changed the rules, stipulating that any publisher selling a digital subscription on a website must also make the same subscription offer within the app, from which Apple would take a 30% cut. Publishers have been furious about this, but there's nothing they can do about it. If they want to do business on the iTunes store, then they have to do it Apple's way.</p><p>In itself, this was just an example of the Big Unfriendly Giant flexing its muscles, but it could be a harbinger of things to come.</p><p>Umberto Eco once wrote a memorable essay arguing that the <a href="http://www.themodernword.com/eco/eco_mac_vs_pc.html" title="">Apple Mac was a Catholic device</a>, while the IBM PC was a Protestant one. His reasoning was that, like the Roman church, Apple offered a guaranteed route to salvation – the Apple Way – provided one stuck to it. PC users, on the other hand, had to take personal responsibility for working out their own routes to heaven.</p><p>Eco's metaphor applies with a vengeance to the new generations of Apple iDevices, which are rigidly controlled appliances. You may think you own your lovely, shiny new iPhone or iPad, but in reality an invisible virtual string links it back to Apple HQ at One Infinite Loop, Cupertino.</p><p>You can't install anything on it that hasn't had the prior approval of Mr Jobs and his subordinates. And if you are foolish enough to break the rules and seek your own route to salvation, then you may find when you next try to sync it with iTunes that it has turned into an expensive, beautifully designed paperweight. If that isn't power, then I don't know what is.</p></div>

I run a small business and I can't tell you what a relief it was nearly 12 years ago now when we switched from PCs to Apple.</p><p>Before that, we had to have a computer repair company on retainer to deal with all of the viruses and problems with freezing and lost files that happened with our PCs. I was nervous about spending the substantially extra money it took to switch to Macs, but we wound up saving that and many times more because of Mac's reliability.</p><p>And that doesn't even consider the hours of aggravation we used to suffer with PCs. The purpose of computers is to help us do our work. I know some people enjoy playing around with special programs and other internal things. That's great for them. But don't turn snarky about those of us who use computers as a tool to accomplish other goals.</p><p>If Bill Gates' products were as reliable as Apple's, we never would have switched. Maybe Apple is overstepping now, but tell me another company anywhere in the world that emphasizes quality they way they do. When you buy something from them, it works and it lasts. We're still using computers we bought in 2003 although we've upgraded others.</p><p>I wish every company, no matter what it makes, would learn from Apple and make high-quality products.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9839182">224</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9839182"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9839182" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9839182" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9839184"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/yahew" title="User profile page">yahew</a> <p class="date">6 March 2011 2:01AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <blockquote><p>Things will look different in a couple of years when Android matures.<br/>There is also the possibility of an Android/Chrome hybrid running on a multicore ARM CPU in a desktop.

It has dominated so far by being ahead of the curve in delivering information (be it video, music, apps) from the internet and people have been going for Apple products because it is also ahead of the hardware curve. But when things inevitably start leveling out going forward as the internet matures, products that will match their ease of use will become available if they aren't already there. I weaned myself away from an Iphone to an Android phone, don't miss the former and consider myself liberated from the Itunes ball-and-chain (of course I'm tied to the Android Market, but it's far less intrusive than Itunes and since it is a work-in-progress one can expect better things from it). On the hardware side, there are now a plethora of Android phones providing a similar experience at dramatically lower cost than the Iphone. As for music, video subscriptions they are really passe. Entertainment moguls want to replicate their brick-and-mortar CD/DVD distribution models on the net and it just won't happen. Much like how the internet has upended the distribution of physical things, distribution of intellectual property is also being upended. I don't know where it will end up, but I do know that it will not be an Itunes type which merely emulates a brick-and-mortar store.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9839568">15</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9839568"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9839568" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9839568" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9839595"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/mechaman" title="User profile page">mechaman</a> <p class="date">6 March 2011 4:16AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>Ah, I remeber the early days when Apple and it's addicts made much of their open architecture (as compared to, say, Atari) and that their PC was a 'serious' machine,(as opposed to, say, the Atari) although they also made much of having more games for their machine.

Complain, complain, complain. Capitalism, the only economic system to drive progress on planet earth, has a dirty little secret. Dominance breeds abuse. Apple is growing into that size, into that place of dominance. </p><p>Every company out there that starts out as the underdog eventually grows into this position or gets crushed. IBM is an evil empire, Microsoft is an evil empire, AT&amp;T is an evil empire, etc, etc. We consumers have to flirt with the devil, until that devil gets too big for his britches, then we defect to a newcomer, and support that one till it reaches dominance. "Meet the new boss, Same as the old boss." </p><p>Apple has created a very fine and functional universe of products that work well together. The majority of people, called consumers, would like their electronics to play nice together. Apple has succeeded and continues to succeed in doing that very very well. One day we'll all jump ship and begin supporting other technological underdogs. Today may be your day to jump ship, but it's not the day for all of us yet. Right now, I'm happy to have all my toys work without having to become an IT geek to make it work. Oh, yeah, Android's app store just dumped 50 apps for mal-ware problems. Apple's rigid control seems to obviate most of those problems. It's not perfect, but I'm still enjoying watching the company that was nearly dead in the early 90s, rise like Phoenix from the ashes. Yes, it's comeuppance is coming, but it's not today.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9839823">32</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9839823"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9839823" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9839823" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9839841"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/astra4" title="User profile page">astra4</a> <p class="date">6 March 2011 6:43AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>This article comes a little bit late...</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9839841">6</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9839841"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9839841" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9839841" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9839853"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/23/physiocrat/d24cb5dd-283e-4fcc-b393-bbfe3ff5f3b2/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/physiocrat" title="User profile page">physiocrat</a> <p class="date">6 March 2011 6:48AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>Never been keen on Apple, having tried it.

While all about me were using PCs (and treating me as if I were some kind of loony tunes maverick), I doggedly stuck to Macs. Now it seems I'm an elderly, infantilised sad sack clinging to the AppleMac teat and being unwittingly manipulated by the evil genius of Cupertino. Well, what a fool am I to prefer using beautifully designed equipment which does what I want it to do without requiring me to become a full-on computer nerd. Given the ups and downs of Apple over the years, I shall be very surprised if it retains its first mover advantages because if anything has been demonstrated by their success it is that the market really does work and that sooner or later an innovation will come along which will change the game and challenge their supremacy. Meanwhile, I shall enjoy using my various Mac devices (tho not an i-phone -- they're way too expensive) and get on with a life that is enriched rather than diminished by the evil genius of Cupertino.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9840835">10</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9840835"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9840835" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9840835" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9840837"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/unistrut" title="User profile page">unistrut</a> <p class="date">6 March 2011 9:58AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>Quicktime also.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9840837">8</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9840837"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9840837" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9840837" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9840856"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/23/MorseCode/666aa547-b8e6-4894-b081-9ae62fefddfd/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/MorseCode" title="User profile page">MorseCode</a> <p class="date">6 March 2011 10:00AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>Will the Guardian ever stop ranting about evil corporations?</p><p>If you don't the way Apple products work, then don't buy them!

The interesting thing is that their behaviour has not yet led to successful anti-trust actions such as that which led to Microsoft being fined in the EU. So it may be worse, but may also be perfectly legal.</p><p>The easiest way out, I feel, is to take the highway rather than My Way. Get yourself an Android phone! Apple's interaction design is second to none, as I've said many times. The do all of Microsoft's "innovation". The closed policies, however, are not for me.</p><p><b>MZMN</b> - </p><blockquote><p>that said, i feel like from the stand point of global society it is less of an accomplishment that Microsoft's scale-able and easily usable operating system, the big innovation from the 90s.</p></blockquote><p>Most of it was actually a big innovation from the 80s. The first Apple Mac already had most of the key user-interface features in 1984 that Windows "innovated" with Windows 95 and later. </p><p>The real key to Microsoft's mysterious success with its sewer of an operating system, I think today, apart from the abuse of a monopoly which it first had to acquire, was not MS's cleverness but IBM's mistake. Apple had the better operating system, but you could buy machines from anyone with Microsoft's on it. Apple controlled its hardware architecture rigidly, thus achieving quality, but IBM let its PC standard be used freely, this losing control of the market for hardware while Windows provided a common software base. A monopoly for the inferior operating system, epidemics of malware and tendonitis and high-profile anti-trust cases have been the result.</p><p>The upshot, which I'm noticing in the jobs market again today, is that companies could resort to third-party hardware solutions if they went with Windows, but seem never to have noticed that they were eliminating third-party solutions for software, which was really increasingly the key to their businesses. Choosing Apple would not have helped, of course, but it's still irritating to be sent forms and asked for CVs in a single proprietary format from a company with whose products you are not looking for work. My wife even has MS Office on her Mac to get around the reality that people do not use an industry-standard document format in e-mail attachments most of the time but a proprietary one from a single company.</p><p>The industry seems uncomplainingly to have accepted that to do business with software it is desirable to pay a Microsoft Tax by forcing those you deal with also to use proprietary solutions at the expense of your own flexibility. If Microsoft goes tits-up - a day for which I pray with some fervency and little hope - many, many companies will find that they have left themselves without a fall-back. (Or if it gets mired in legal problems again, a rather more likely scenario.) Basically, software companies believe it is more important for Microsoft to make money than for them to do so themselves.</p><p>So no, I don't really believe that Apple has been worse. But it may be neither of the big companies' fault.</p><blockquote><p>there was more to fear from Microsoft in the 90s than there is from Apple today, and Microsoft isn't really that scary anymore, is it?</p></blockquote><p>Yes and no. I'm still all but forced to work with it during the day. Nokia's decision to go with Windows - which will hopefully sink the company, to which I used to be loyal - gives them another foothold in mobile computing.

Apple has no responsibility to prop up other businesses. Remember who's "furious" here... this is the world of multi-national publishing corporations like Conde Nast or Rupert Murdoch's HarperCollins.</p><p>And for Apple this is a no-brainer - Business Studies 101!</p><p>The reason Apple have earned all the (deserved!) plaudits in John's first couple of paragraphs is that they always put the customer experience first. And it's really simple. As a customer, if I use the in-app subscription then find out I could get the same product from the same company on the same gadget cheaper, I'm going to be narked off. Repeat that by thousands of customers and that's going to hurt the Apple brand. So pure commercial logic drives the clause. </p><p>And for publishers, there's a fair choice. Stay out of the app environment. Market your wares through your own web sites, which we can all access using browsers. Or opt to engage with Apple's huge customer base, using Apple's e-commerce system and pay Apple a commission. </p><p>Now remind me, what's the issue here John?</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9841192">5</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9841192"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9841192" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9841192" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9841197"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/Tuescon" title="User profile page">Tuescon</a> <p class="date">6 March 2011 10:36AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>You only have to look at the logo....the apple from the tree of knowledge with a bite taken out of it....to know this firm has always had insidious intentions.

She built a UK iPad2, the Homework tablet, for teaching Primary School kids Numeracy in a range of contexts (with a camera), back in 2005. This is documented in her 2010 book Redesigning Learning Contexts; http://amzn.to/agl0Pw <br/>The Homework Tablet was designed using the 'conceptual pull' model of her Ecology of Resources, not on a 'technology-push' basis. It was designed to meet specific learning needs identified through a participatory design process which included teachers, learners and parents. <br/>The great celebrations of iPad2 and Apples' dominance (or not) this week shows that we still celebrate shiny gadgets and have no idea how to interpret their use nor how to identify what their social impact might be.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9841270">4</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9841270"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9841270" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9841270" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9841279"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/23/SteveFarr/0ad3b65c-2d39-43ef-8b2f-1f4169151a35/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/SteveFarr" title="User profile page">SteveFarr</a> <p class="date">6 March 2011 10:43AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>Hey thanks for reminding me John.

They failed time and time again to ask the question, "How do we make money giving people what they want?" iTunes didn't answer that question completely (you can't do the same with an iTunes-downloaded track as you can with one you ripped from your CD) but it answered it well enough to satisfy a lot of people. </p><p>Today the traditional big record companies may be doing poorly, but they would be doing much worse were it not for iTunes. Today, more and more artists are talking direct to their audiences and don't need a record company in the way creaming off most of the income.

There's an ecosystem of half-a-dozen companies, all who came up with innovations that beat Microsoft and Apple to the punch. Yet we're arguing over which of two companies has the most evil and obnoxious monopoly. The winner takes <b>all</b>.</p><p>But I suppose every player has a "fair" chance to be 1% better and thus take all the profit from the entire business.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9841645">2</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9841645"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9841645" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9841645" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9841755"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/marbleflat" title="User profile page">marbleflat</a> <p class="date">6 March 2011 11:31AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>Pseudonyms (6 March 2011 1:16AM);</p><blockquote><p>Cue the typically fatuous graun article with easy to read "evil empire" header so that the connection between product and the U.S. will not be lost, thereby providing said reader with the comforting thought that they are, at least, STILL superior to most americans. </p></blockquote><p><br/>Somebody <i>really</i> needs to get that OCD Guardian=anti-American thing out of their system for good.

However, I think you don't realise that it is Apple's control of the user experience that makes their devices wildly successful. Apple is rubbish for developers and content producers (like magazines) as they have to jump through countless of hoops to get their content (and pay a toll) to consumers. However, from a consumer perspective that's irrelevant: you get a wild choice of software in teh app store without the pollution of rubbish that you get in say the Android market. It's the polish experience that makes Apple's devices attractive. For a free software fan like myself, Apple devices make me feel claustrophobic. I like tinkering with devices and making them do what I want. However, unlike most of my free software peers, I recognise that the majority of people are not interested in that at all. They're interested in getting their task done in a simple and elegant way. The great thing is that you have choice, if you don't like Apple buy a PC, and if you can install linux or another open source OS to tinker with. Apple has all the right to control what is sold on iTunes, since iTunes is not the market, it's just a store (a very popular one). Indeed, one can buy music for the apple device in Amazon and other competitors (even the kindle is in the App store I believe)&gt;</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9842681">6</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9842681"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9842681" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9842681" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9842768"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/09/02/cta_262190_10/ee20eb59-5eb0-4502-939c-5a9ebe2b77c8/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/JohnClifton" title="User profile page">JohnClifton</a> <p class="date">6 March 2011 1:14PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>I agree with nearly all of that, some good common paranoia-free sense.</p><p>The bit I disagree with is the Apple is rubbish for developers bit.</p><p>Developers have flocked to Apple because it provides a smooth easy to use environment and they can earn plenty of money to reward their efforts.</p><p>Otherwise an excellent post.</p><blockquote><p> Apple has all the right to control what is sold on iTunes, since iTunes is not the market, it's just a store (a very popular one)</p></blockquote><p>Absolutely.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9842768">3</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9842768"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9842768" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9842768" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9842836"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/Pyrrhonist" title="User profile page">Pyrrhonist</a> <p class="date">6 March 2011 1:21PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>Interesting that despite the elleged decline of America all the leading organisations of the cyberworld-Apple, Microsoft,Amazon,Google-are American.

The design teams for these products are huge.</p><p>Apple always were control freaks. No surprising that their reputation begins to slip when they start doing unfriendly things. They used to have a cute story about the speed of their chips - about 'how slower is better'. I see they've come up with similar bull shit for the iPad - retinal whatsits. Hahahahahahaha. Nobody believes it. The aerial problem with the iPhone? If anything, these bloody things are *over-designed*. The iPad is a case in point.</p><p>I recently moved from iPhoto to Aperture, and I thought the transition would be easy. I mean, Aperture is an "upgrade" from iPhoto, right? Well, it turns out that the transition is highly problematic, even for someone like me who's been in the software industry for 20 years. Some photographs had even 'disappeared', but were still somehow kept hanging around. Worse, this is software I'd PAID for. So bright and shiny and spanking new on the surface, but somewhere in the bowels, a stinking pile of doggy-doo waiting for you to wade through.

It was ruthless in dispersal of its functional approach to design, production and manufacture. It was better at globalism than the others.</p><p>I stopped to consider this for some time. How was it that this company had created this aesthetic and alterntive approach that stood itself against the mono-corporatiset world view, yet it was structurally at the leading edge of a new form of exploitation.</p><p>I tested this agaist some collegues and friends with some simple yet bombastic statements: Apple is a progressive company; Apple hates corporatism; Apple users are a community; and so on. The results were clear, everyone thought Apple was at the head of some counterculture.</p><p>The more I thought about it and looked into the more I reralised that we had been duped. The user community was part of marketing, its "for the res of us" philosophy aimed at the identity conscious but them homogenous.</p><p>And then cam the i-series. I for internet, I for individual. The me-me-me culture of the i-pod and the subsequently the i-phone stood starkley againts the socio-ehtical self-image of Apple users. And then came the slavery cases, the poisoning case, and the market capitalisation.</p><p>I realised that the what was broken was not the Apple ideal by my dream.

Until they "invented" the app store, they were just another minority-interest computer company, that also made phones.

If users are happy with their easy to use solutions, including the iPad, iPod Touch, iPhone, iMacs, Macbooks and the unparalleled ecosystem with at its centre iTunes, then what is the problem. Apple Inc. has a curated ecosystem to stop the junk that pervades the likes of Android, which is becoming the fragmented joke that everyone predicted last year (networks putting their own UIs on the phones and pre-loading with a load of app junk).</p><p>The main point of this argument is that now that publishers are being asked to contribute part of their subscription revenue to Apple Inc. if they want to use this powerful content distribution model, that this is somehow unfair. Apple Inc. has built this unparalleled capability, so why the hell should they not reap the reward. Anyone else is free to compete with Apple Inc., so stop the whining, and build a viable competitor to iTunes and the App Store.</p><p>I would argue, from an end user standpoint, that the real rip off is when substandard services are offered to end users, who then pay their hard earned cash for such rubbish; some examples:</p><p>1. substandard OS upgrades from Microsoft over many years, full of bugs! Just go into a PCWorld anywhere across the UK and watch the poor blighters queuing at the PC clinics to have their poor PCs fixed.<br/>2. cobbled together beige box PCs without one ounce of design or consideration for the end user.<br/>3. phones from many different vendors over 20 years that were all cobbled together pieces of garbage. Just consider how many phone providers prior to the iPhone sold phones that could 'surf the web' .... what a laugh. Apple Inc. changed that, thank god for the human race!!<br/>4. Networks that have provided expensive and ridiculous cobbled mobile services for years. Now they have to bow to Apple Inc. to be allowed the good fortune of paying $600+ for each iPhone so that their 'we want an experience that is superior customers' can get iPhones on reasonably priced contract deals (that obviously users are willing to pay, because it is happening everywhere).</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9845260">2</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9845260"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9845260" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9845260" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9845370"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/paulbecke" title="User profile page">paulbecke</a> <p class="date">6 March 2011 5:49PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>@BertandChorizo</p><p>I don't know about the hardware aspect (except its carcinogenic mobile phones) but I believe there is something uniquely vile about the software industry, pretty much in line with the overall degeneracy of the West with its recrudescence of corporatism. </p><p>The dishonesty of its advertising online beggars belief. And ironically, they don't seem to understand that when you say 'no;' you mean 'no'; and the more they try to force their sale on you, the more you will dig in.</p><p>Not only have used-car salesmen always been more honest, they have always been more intelligent. When my wife and I said we liked a particular car, the salesman said, "Don't make up your mind yet, come and have a look at some of these others." </p><p>But when you make such a decision, you have to make it final, because you can alway find attractive features about other cars. But we had to repeatedly demur, and by doing so, each time, we closed the actual sale for him more and more firmly; we closed the door to his office behind us.</p><p>Every time I open a new site, I have to adjust my picture to fit the full screen, by clicking on the little square on the top right of the screen.

If Microsoft goes tits-up - a day for which I pray with some fervency and little hope - many, many companies will find that they have left themselves without a fall-back. (Or if it gets mired in legal problems again, a rather more likely scenario.) Basically, software companies believe it is more important for Microsoft to make money than for them to do so themselves.</p></blockquote><p>Yes the real driver of innovation and competition in the marketplace is, or should be, open standards but this doesn't seem to be an issue most people are aware of, sadly, so there is not enough drive from our governments to force software or hardware companies to adhere to standards. </p><p>Needless to say the likes of Microsoft spend almost unlimited amounts of time and money ensuring they appear to be supporting open standards whilst fighting tooth and nail to retain lock in to their own products. In this respect Apple are just as bad as MS and it will take more government/EU intervention to improve anything in this area since there's no real motivation for companies to do it themselves.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9845886">1</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9845886"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9845886" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9845886" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9845926"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/HuwLyanThomas" title="User profile page">HuwLyanThomas</a> <p class="date">6 March 2011 6:45PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>"...it rankled that Apple took 30%, but – hey – at least it would bring to an end the parasitic free riding that was endemic on the web.

Windows7 itself is probably the same as Linux security-wise, but Windows big problem is the poor security of app software. People need to be clear about this :- Linux (or properly GNU/Linux)(eg Ubuntu or Fedora or Mint or Debian etc etc) is not just an OS - it includes AN ENTIRE SYSTEM - with every task you can think of represented by an app, that is a FREE download. That means Device Drivers( a big Windows bugbear), graphics,studio software,open Office, every Web-based thing there is, heavy duty enterprise quality software, you name it, etc. etc. - all FREE. Yes, some software "brands" aren't available with Linux (yet), but its just like "own brand" food in the supermarket. Their own stuff is often better than the branded stuff, &amp; its the same with software.</p><p>Its also worth pointing out that every single PC that is infected &amp; part of the multi-million strong population of giant criminal botnets(at the behest of organised crime) is a Windows machine(could be your PC - would you know if it was?).

Not just in terms of what Apple has achieved in terms of their products but all of the things that they have touched:<br/>Product manuals.<br/>Retail<br/>Packaging</p><p>Microsoft's business was made off the back of Apple's innovation. Ditto Google with Android.<br/>Apple don't mind. They produce things that they know work and are well designed. They are perfectly well aware that most people will buy the cheaper version which doesn't work as well but purports to do so.<br/>Having given the world the GUI (in the form that every single computer OS from Windows onwards uses) The iTunes ecosystem which others are still trying to get right. The smartphone. Ditto. And the Pad, ditto the writer of this blog would do well to reflect on this and trynand name one piece of innovation that anyone at Microsoft or Google has come up with.....so whilst these copycat companies are there to exploit people of little discernment they will be happy when Apple loses its shine because there will be nothing new for them to make. Until a new Apple comes along. <br/>Appreciate that it is a bitter pill to swallow and I understand why some people don't like Apple things...but there is no denying that anyone using a Windows operating system is using a sub-standard Mac OS and anyone on an Android phone or Pad is using a sub-standard iOS. But there will always be cheapskates and it is these people that the Microsofts and the Googles and all the rest wish to exploit.<br/>And if you don't believe me..check out the dates of the launches of these products.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9847006">1</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9847006"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9847006" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9847006" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9847050"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/TheRealCmdrGravy" title="User profile page">TheRealCmdrGravy</a> <p class="date">6 March 2011 8:46PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p><b>pepegalego</b></p><blockquote><p>The likelihood of getting an attack is obviously higher as 85% of the world's computer users are probably pc users.<br/>You can bet your backside that if Apple ever get anywhere near that market share in software, they will be hit by viruses left, right and centre.</p></blockquote><p>Not really, the Unix foundation Apple and Linux are built from is inherently multi user and network aware in a way that Windows is not which allows it to enforce security in a much more effective and less intrusive manner.</p><p>I often have to rebuild my friends windows PCs when they get hit by viruses and always make sure that I have set them up with separate admin and user accounts in an attempt to mitigate the effects of the next batch of dodgy software they download and run.

The only reason I jailbroke my iPhone was to install an app called Privacy and only available on Cydia. It stops the device from sending anonymous usage stats to all &amp; sundry. Apple does demand that developers give users the option of blocking info from being sent but there are one or two developers who ignore this (at the risk of having their App pulled).</p><blockquote><p>By jailbreaking it, you are actually proving to all that the Apple experience is not perfect, and that in fact the walled garden approach is not acceptable and Apple should take a different route.</p></blockquote><p>I have never claimed anywhere on the whole entire interwebs that the Apple experience is perfect -- I will say though that it is the best <b>I've</b> had (never ever questioned any one else, and I've used smart phones before people began calling them smartphones</p><blockquote><p>Make your mind up, please.</p></blockquote><p>Made up my mind in the mid-to-late-80s -- proud to say I have never owned a Windows PC and don't intend to ever own one.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9848406">1</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9848406"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9848406" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9848406" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9848429"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/23/QuetzalcoatlUK/799b6b8d-79f8-4c52-aadd-28f4cae1e9a6/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/QuetzalcoatlUK" title="User profile page">QuetzalcoatlUK</a> <p class="date">6 March 2011 11:07PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>@ marbleflat</p><p>I second what boringoldchelsea said.

If this would be a comprehensive tour of all the things connecting to the issue things would not be so white and black. I have an iPhone and a Galaxy also so I know both sides pretty well. What I get for the closeness of iPhone is a guaranteed minimum quality of apps which is non existent on the Android market. <br/>Also from the developer side, if I make an app for the iPhone I can sell it on iTunes and have a uniform access to the millions of users worldwide who can buy my app on a channel they know and trust. <br/>If I make my app for Android I get tackled with market segmentation (all mobil OS market share graphs take Android as one, where in reality you have devices ranging from OS version 1.6 - 3.0 with a wide variety of capabilities and screen sizes). After tackling the painful (but not impossible) QA problems I encounter with the problem of non-free apps. I happen to live in a country that is not on the short list of Google that can sell and buy payed apps on the market. If I solve the problem of relocating the business (at least on paper) to an accepted country, my payed app would show up only for people who have their phones registered in those countries that are on the short list. If I make a free app, every android user will see it in the market, but I need to solve the payment with microtransactions and some payment gateway and the payment method will be different (even if slightly) within each app for each developer. Just to add some confusion, adwords and adsense is a working product in this country also, so I can get buy and sell ad impressions which makes the available countries in Android even more curious.<br/>There are things on both sides that are good and bad.

The truth of the matter is most iterations of the iOS, on most devises have been successfully broken, and a court of law in the US has even deemed this activity as totally legal. This legitimises creation of apps solely available on the Cydia store, where content providers can keep alll of their shiny pennies. I am even able to use the App store, and back up using iTunes. </p><p>Also, Apple's decision to keep 30% of all subscriptions should be their undoing. This 30% will include apps that have a long standing support base on the devise, that may be just a little peeved that all that revenue has just been pulled from them. Apple might soon realise that it is the content creators that add so much value to their devises, and if these providors realise their collective power and migrate to an alternate platform removing support from iOS, Apple's dominance in the mobile space might just be over.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9851158">1</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9851158"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9851158" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9851158" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9851544"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/anothersurfoid" title="User profile page">anothersurfoid</a> <p class="date">7 March 2011 10:10AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <blockquote><p>an invisible virtual string links it back</p></blockquote><p>likewise the kindle, whose owner memorably destroyed all the copies of 1984 that people thought they'd bought.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9851544">0</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9851544"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9851544" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9851544" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9851826"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2011/03/07/CommyTooper/3768d511-44c5-4f31-81fb-4115c4aafa16/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/CommyTooper" title="User profile page">CommyTooper</a> <p class="date">7 March 2011 10:31AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>An Apple a day ...keeps William Tell in target practice!</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9851826">1</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9851826"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9851826" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9851826" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9851851"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/rabaisse" title="User profile page">rabaisse</a> <p class="date">7 March 2011 10:32AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>Apple.

The hysteria over the whole "walled garden" thing is absurd, and for two very good reasons:</p><p>(1) The garden may be walled, but it's immense. Tens of thousands of apps and the like. The complaint that the only ones available are those that Apple permits to be available would only really hit home if Apple were stingy about what they allow - but they're not.</p><p>(2) The fact that Apple takes a cut of all the content you buy for your device is one of the things that keep the price of the device itself down. One of the reasons why the iPad is, on the whole, cheaper than its competitors is that Apple sell it for, probably, very little profit, and make the money on the App Store. That's one reason why the Xoom is so much more expensive - Motorola can't make money from it that way.</p><p>If you don't like the way the deal works, then by all means don't participate in it. You may not like it as a business model, but to call it "evil" is absurd. I don't know what it is about the subject of Apple that makes people throw reason out of the window and start slavering (on both sides), but everyone really needs to take a few deep breaths and calm down. It's a company that makes luxury gadgets.

People will always gravitate toward those who make the most sense to them and are willing to help them. Naturally they will then speak well about them. In my case in point, this is how I describe my most recent Apple experience.</p><p>After six-plus years, I decided that it was time for a new computer… and let’s be serious here, what’s not to love about a new iMac? The setup and transition to my new machine was flawless, <i>well almost.</i> There were some improvements that I had to adapt to but that was the whole idea, wasn’t it? I was fascinated by the functions of the new iLife software that used facial recognition so sort pictures of my favorite people amongst other things… but suddenly there was a glitch!</p><p>My iMac had, using a utility called Migration Assistant, seamlessly transferred over the files and data from more than fifty web pages from my old Mac to the new machine and to my personal supporting site, MobileMe. But some pages weren’t there and I was beside myself. However, one call to AppleCare got me three different people who narrowed the focus down from the new hardware and software to the web services and the transfer process. A great senior technical advisor remotely helped me to find my missing files from the sophisticated underpinnings of my old Mac and to move them to the new machine where they could be published to the Internet again.</p><p>When my first attempts to republish failed, I frantically contacted Apple once again and left a message for the advisor who had helped me. While he wasn’t scheduled for work that day, his colleague who was monitoring his messages did call me and asked if he could help. I thanked him and told him that I’d wait for the gentleman who had gotten me this far, since I had also sent him an email explaining my progress, my predicament and the lingering problems. But I didn’t have to wait for his response. The wizards of Apple were continuing to work on my issues behind the scenes and tonight all my webpages magically reappeared in all their glory!</p><p>That’s where I get my religion…</p><p>Bob Magnant<br/><a href="http://web.mac.com/magnant/" rel="nofollow">http://web.mac.com/magnant/ </a></p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9851937">0</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9851937"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9851937" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9851937" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9852038"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/Briar" title="User profile page">Briar</a> <p class="date">7 March 2011 10:46AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>I wonder if users "love" of Apple is in fact a carefully fanned and fostered infatuation.

winner of x factor is a national debate are unable to resist.<br/>the only way to break free of these shackles is to cause monetary losses its the only language these executives understand.its very similar to the rising cost of trying to follow a football team.<br/>lets hurt them where it hurts most.<br/>if looked at a rational way the iphone should have barely sold.think about it no

However, these are Apple suppliers and not directly controlled by Apple (not that this excuses Apple in the slightest). Living in China, I know that citizens are aware and upset by this.

The interesting thing about Google is they <i>never</i> delete your search history. All of the terms you enter into Google a stored for as long as they want to keep the for whatever reason they see fit. Their game is advertising and in that game many do not ply by the "accepted" rules. Remember 8 years ago when advertisers would force pop-up and pop-under ads on your computer and there was really no way to stop it? Have you seen those Flash ads that take up your entire screen? Do you have any idea how much your information is worth to advertisers to they can target your demographic effectively? This is where the anxiety of "free" internet products come into play. With Apple, they have a clear business model and revenue stream. It is super effective and makes them a lot of money, but it works. And you have the option to purchase alternate products. Apple in no way has a monopoly in cellphones, computers, laptops, tablets, MP3 players, etc. But they have made their product the most attractive to many buyers.</p><p>Google on the other hand - why would they even make a phone? That does <i>not</i> fit their business model. However their research determined that in just a few years, people will be doing a great amount of their web browsing on mobile devices. They wanted to make sure they we a part of this skew in the way people used the web, so the lose money by focusing some of their developers on making a phone OS based off linux that can be given away, but they must be the default search engine, it must be tied to your Google Account (more demographics) and must include some default Google services. Their Navigation is nice and traffic info is nice, I admit. But what are they collecting about me? One, the phone is a "connected by an invisible virtual string" back to Mountain View. If you use Assisted GPS or use Wireless Networks for determining your location, it will send to Google (to store, of course) the names, MAC addresses, and signal strengths of all wireless signals in the vicinity of your phone. They also do the same thing with the Google car that goes around taking street view pics. If your house is on Street View, don't think they wee only taking pics. They were gathering your WiFI network info, MAC address, etc. to use for their own purpose. Google hoards data about its users and it is at least identifiable back to you for <b>1 1/2 years!</b> If you have a Google Account and are signed in, it us tied to you personally. If you are not signed in, it still is pretty much tied to you from cookies on your computer. If you clear your cookies, they still have your IP address.

I don't buy into it, however, for one main reason:</p><p>Even with Apple going through their media-oriented, money-grubbing phase the last few years, they still show far more respect for the customer, and particularly for the <i>intelligence</i> of the customer, than Microsoft ever did. Making the paying customer feel like an idiot, or blaming the customer rather than fix long-standing grossly-negligent defects in their own products, have never been in the Apple playbook. They've been the foundation of Microsoft's business strategy since at least Windows 3.1(1992) if not for years before.</p><p>To riff on your BMW analogy, Apple historically have had the philosophy that "good enough, isn't," and that's been reflected in the continuous improvement and refinement of the vast majority of their products, certainly in this century. As a user and as a developer, I am much happier — and <i>far</i> more productive — working in the Apple ecosystem than doing battle against that of Microsoft (who have been my bread and butter since the late 1980s).</p><p>Apple generally build on top of open standards in the Web, in networking, in security, and so on; they have a far better record of contributing innovation back to the community at large than Microsoft have done. By comparison, Microsoft have infamously "never met a standard they couldn't break," to quote a well-known developer; their business plan is commonly known as "embrace, engulf, extinguish;" turning open industry-wide standards into proprietary, non-interoperable ones (which is why sites "designed for Microsoft Internet Exploder") typically look rubbish on standard-compliant browsers, and vice versa).</p><p>Yes, Apple have drifted away from their roots. I attribute this to Steve Jobs' ties to and affection for the Big Media industry, as witnessed by associations with Pixar, Disney, the New York Times and others. But I rather expect — and as a shareholder, I hope and would vote for — a post-Jobs Apple voluntarily breaking itself apart, sending the giant media company off to build its own future independent of what once was Apple Computer. The rump corporation would be a fraction of the current size and, some argue, not nearly as good a business.</p><p>But, to paraphrase an endlessly-repeated bank commercial, a company sooner or later has to reconcile its ambition with its conscience; to look not only at the profit it makes but how it makes that profit. I hope a post-Jobs Apple will take that good hard look in the mirror, and go back to being the BMW or Lamborghini of the computer world; never again treating its customers as <i>consumers,</i> i.e. "<a href="http://cluetrain.com/book/markets.html" rel="nofollow">a gullet whose only purpose in life is to gulp products and crap cash</a>."</p><p><i>That</i> company is one I'd happily be an enthusiastic, evangelistic customer of. If that Apple is a BMW, then Microsoft is a 1977 Ford Pinto. And they're in the process of being rear-ended.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9855674">4</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9855674"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9855674" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9855674" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9855754"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/23/savale/7a25411d-e5b5-4cc2-ac96-c60578d63575/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/savale" title="User profile page">savale</a> <p class="date">7 March 2011 2:19PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>In the 80s and 90s the problem has that Windows dominance also meant problems with file compatability across different operating systems.

In so many ways, Apple lock consumers un-necessarily, willfully ignoring industry standards for no good reason. They could've made great products which worked well together whilst still being standards-compliant. This aspect increases the total cost of ownership of their products without returning any commensurate value for the user.</p><p>Again, under theoretically free markets users would have perfect knowledge of what they were getting themselves into and so would evaluate this total cost of ownership when they embarked on their Apple purchases, and trade this off against the undoubted other benefits. For some the cost would be too high, for others it would be worth it.</p><p>But I would suggest that users typically have extremely imperfect knowledge in this domain. I really think they have no idea that buying an iPhone for example will lock them into paying Apple so much extra for apps, content, and peripherals.

<p>@venombrood:</p><blockquote><p>But I would suggest that users typically have extremely imperfect knowledge in this domain. I really think they have no idea that buying an iPhone for example will lock them into paying Apple so much extra for apps, content, and peripherals</p></blockquote><p>I have an iPhone and an iPad. There's about 20GB of music on both. Of that, I'd say probably 5 albums were bought on iTunes. The rest is a combination of CD rips (mostly) and various digital downloads (Amazon is often cheaper than iTunes.)</p><p>I have multiple movies and TV shows on my iPad. None of them were bought in iTunes, but ripped in from DVDs or bought at other sources. </p><p>I regularly watch all my videos and movies on my iPad both at home and away. I usually go via a third party app that streams media that isn't even in iTunes format from my hard drive.</p><p>I do not have to pay Apple "so much extra" for apps, either. 70% of the money I pay for apps is going to the developer, and they are the ones who set the prices of their software, not Apple. Most of it is insanely, eye-wateringly cheap. The rest of it is merely extremely good value (depending on the quality of the software of course).</p><p>Apple only offers a couple of peripherals for their phones and iPads etc. I have never bought a peripheral for my iPhone or iPad that was <i>only</i> offered by Apple. Cases, the most commonly bought peripheral, are available from a huge number of vendors, at a wide range of prices.</p><p>So I'm not sure what point you're trying to make about Apple locking its customers into an expensive future of media and peripheral purchases. It's perfectly possible to load your devices with media that never even got a sniff of iTunes, in a legal and Apple-sanctioned way.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9858246">2</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9858246"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9858246" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9858246" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9858307"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/spokey" title="User profile page">spokey</a> <p class="date">7 March 2011 4:49PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>As good a place as any to ask.

That's exactly how it's worked out with apps and in the past, without being too specific about who he's referring to, Jobs has made mention of advising labels to do the same and they haven't.</p><p>I suspect the labels are basically in the middle of the biggest denial of their lives.

Would we accept desktop computers where the hardware / OS manufacturer takes 30% of any application software revenue? Would we accept cars where the original manufacturer takes 30% of revenue of any tires you fit? Taking something for providing the retail outlet is reasonable, but it does seem like a lot when Google takes precisely 0% for Android apps. Also in most other markets the producer has a choice of retailers, but in the case of the AppStore there is no competition.</p><p>They may not make the peripherals but I suspect they get licensing revenue from those companies that do make them, so some of the additional cost will be passed on to you in that way. If on the hardware side for example they made Apple products which used microUSB or microSD standards this would be better for consumers but they wouldn't get this licensing revenue.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9859050">1</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9859050"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9859050" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9859050" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9859357"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/SilverHammer" title="User profile page">SilverHammer</a> <p class="date">7 March 2011 5:55PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>Went into an Apple store-at that trendy shithole dump shopping centre called Westfield in central-west London, on Sunday afternoon..

So, I went back to the desktop to try opening something else, only for the Word screen to kick in suddenly after 10-15 seconds. Happened on two Pro machines, boasting a dual core processor and 3-4GB ram.

Why is that so wrong? </p><p>People saying that Steve Jobs is just a media mogul and that Apple is more like a rotten apple makes me laugh really. Apple is a successful business - what do you want them to do, haul in the reigns and say 'Oh no, d'you know what, let's just stop there. Let's not make any more products; let's allow other companies to take our innovative designs and move ahead of us. Yeah that seems sensible.' Of course not!! Any business wants to further itself, and, not just that, its consumers in the market want it to develop new ideas. </p><p>Some of the comments on here appear to be written with some rather twisted logic - someone saying that Apple is wrong because you're meant to write everything in "motherf*cking Helvetica". I could easily exclaim that I hate Windows because, goddamnit, I have to write in Arial or, heaven forbid, Times New Roman! It's called changing font, dear, and it may be possible that you have some kind of issue relating back to font abuse in your childhood is they offend you that much. I'd get that checked out if I were you. </p><p>Also, I take it most of the negative comments on here came from people who have owned an Apple product, otherwise how would you know if you like them or not? That being the case, haven't you all, therefore, liked the look or liked the idea of the Apple products at one point? Why so sour now? </p><p>Hopefully, in a couple of years, there'll be another successful company that rises up that you can all b*tch about then, because it seems that a lot of commenters on here are just picking a side for the sake of having something to pick on. </p><p>And, <i>Goebbels</i>, would you like some more whine with that? If an individual likes Apple, let them for pity's sake and maybe leave your 'non-discussion' out, because quite frankly referring to someone's opinion as 'soggy-biscuit esque' just seems a tad childish to me.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9862389">2</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9862389"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9862389" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9862389" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9863034"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/23/SteveBallantyne/e5c5221a-35ff-4d49-956b-1a7b8949f57b/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/SteveBallantyne" title="User profile page">SteveBallantyne</a> <p class="date">7 March 2011 11:20PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>I see Google has just remotely deleted 50 Android apps that were actually malware trojans.

Or buy music, books, e-magazines, etc. You are at will to buy any other products out there. You may even decide not to buy anything at all - what a novel idea! Let your credit cards rest for a bit...<br/>Apple is currently successful at what it is doing. The criticism lashed out has shifted from Microsoft to Google and now it's Apple's turn. As for subscriptions, there was never a sound in the past about how much magazines and book publishers were charging us and based on what model. Nobody dared criticize the large publishing houses. Does this have to do with the fact that they owned most publications? How much money did the publishing houses make? Did they offer any publications for free? Did they choose which book/publication they wanted? - you betcha! they controlled every bit and nobody whined.<br/>Now you can download thousands of books for free, authors can upload their own books without needing the publishing houses at all.<br/>Apple's devices make a profit from content on their devices - this is true. Whether they charge too much is a different question. Nobody can dispute the liberating effect their products have on books, music and software. Their model is the right one and there is no going back.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9874869">1</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9874869"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9874869" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9874869" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </div> </div>
