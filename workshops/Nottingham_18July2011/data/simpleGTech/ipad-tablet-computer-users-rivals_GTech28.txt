<div id="article-body-blocks"><p>A friend recently went to a business meeting. He prepared by pulling his laptop out of his bag. All of the clients responded by taking their iPads out of their briefcases.</p><p>These were not gadget freaks or latte-quaffing Hoxton-based web designers, as some imagine <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/ipad" title="More from guardian.co.uk on iPad">iPad</a> users to be. They were a large group of senior civil servants and bankers, in a country well beyond Europe and the US. To them, the iPad wasn't a status symbol; it was a device they had chosen to use because it enhanced their ability to do their job.</p><p>A year on from its arrival, and with the faster, thinner, second-generation model released in the UK on 25 March , <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/apple" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Apple">Apple</a>'s iPad tablet computer still divides opinion. A large group of people insist it is an "overpriced toy" with limited functionality – no keyboard, doesn't run Microsoft Office, can't play Flash video, can't expand its storage. But a growing number believe that, on the contrary, the iPad represents a new frontier in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/computing" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Computing">computing</a>. And they simply don't care what the first group thinks. They're getting on with using their machines.</p><p>We have lived with the PC paradigm for around 30 years now, since IBM introduced its first personal computers and pushed them into businesses in the early 80s. Until the launch of the iPad last year the only comparable change in the market had been the laptop, which led to the emergence of an army of travelling salespeople whose most urgent need was always to find a power point where they could charge their machine's fading battery.</p><p>The iPad seems to be different – a third stage of computing. Horace Dediu, a former analyst with the mobile phone company Nokia who now runs his own consultancy, <a href="http://www.asymco.com/" title="">Asymco</a>, argues that "the definition of a new generation of computing is that the new products rely on new input and output methods, and allow a new population of non-expert users to use the product more cheaply and simply".</p><p>That certainly sounds like the iPad. It shows that it is possible to have something that does all the computing functions you want with a big screen that also has long battery life and weighs almost nothing, certainly compared to a laptop. It is portable and durable, and the touch screen adds another dimension.</p><p>Though it has the most prominent tablet in the market, Apple isn't the only player (see its rivals assessed below). Dozens of companies are using Google's free <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/android" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Android">Android</a> software to power tablets, and Google is helping them along with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)" title="">custom version called "Honeycomb"</a>, designed for iPad-sized Android tablets. <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-20028801-17.html" title="">An estimated 17 million tablets – from Apple and others – were sold in 2010</a>, and that number is likely to keep growing.</p><p>But is it really changing the way we work? We interviewed a range of people in different professions to see whether the iPad is all hype – or whether in future we will all keep taking the tablets. <strong>CA</strong></p><h2>Margaret Manning – businesswoman </h2>    <span class="inline">

<p>Margaret Manning first realised that her iPad was going to change how she worked when she was in hospital, recovering from a minor operation, about a month after buying it. "I realised I could comfortably do emails, download a book to read, watch a film, whatever," she says. "There's no other device that you can do that with. You certainly can't read with a laptop in bed."</p><p>Manning, 50, is the founder and chief executive of Reading Room, a London-based web development agency employing 170 people. She takes the iPad with her to client meetings and presentations: "It's got a wow factor," she says. "I did a presentation that I ran off it, and all the people in the room went, 'Ooh'," she recalls, adding: "They were all bankers."</p><p>To Manning, the iPad's chief virtue is its versatility. She can carry it in her bag to go to clients, check work emails in a coffee shop or train, and then take it to a bar later and kill some time playing a game. It's become her laptop, TV screen, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/ipod" title="More from guardian.co.uk on iPod">iPod</a> and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/iphone" title="More from guardian.co.uk on iPhone">iPhone</a>. "It's adaptive to today's digital age. You can create and consume content in a different way."</p><p>Key to that is the screen size. "The iPhone was a step towards this, but the format is vital. This allows businesses to start using it in a way they couldn't with the iPhone."</p><p>She cites an app that Reading Room has developed for Grains Research Development Corporation in Australia which lets farmers examine crops for disease by comparing them, in the field, to pictures on the iPad. That could be done on a laptop – but it would be cumbersome compared to doing it on the handheld screen.</p><p>She revels in the simplicity of the interface, and says battery life is key: "If it was shorter, that would change the relationship. If I had to travel with plugs and extra batteries that would change things. The iPhone's battery life is too short – it hacks me off."</p><p>Are there any drawbacks? "There are two things that it doesn't do well: the keyboard – if I travel with it, I have to take a lightweight keypad – and voice calls. You can use Skype [the free internet voice call service], but not everybody has Skype, and I can't use it to call a client. " <strong>CA</strong></p><h2>Frasier Speirs – teacher<br /></h2><p>"Nobody has lost a file for a year now," says Fraser Speirs. "Which used to happen every week – someone coming along and saying they couldn't find where they'd saved some work or other."</p><p>Speirs teaches computing studies at the private Cedars School of Excellence in Greenock, and is also the IT co-ordinator there. Last year he went to his bosses with a radical plan: equip every one of the children in both the primary and secondary schools with an iPad. And not just for computing studies: for every lesson. Speirs wants them to replace textbooks, though he admits that is still some way off.</p><p>But the iPads, with their simplified approach to filing (you can't choose where to save a file), have made at least part of his life much simpler.</p><p>The lack of a keyboard wasn't an issue. "The problem with laptops in the classroom is the battery life, and the size and weight. When Apple said that it would last for 10 hours, and we realised it actually did, that was really important. And the size and weight matters too for younger children."</p><p>The primary pupils only use them in school; secondary pupils can take them home. And teachers have them too, which has changed their view of computing.</p><p>Speirs thinks it is time to reconsider how and what we teach children in an internet-connected world. "Previously, we taught technology just for business needs – Excel, PowerPoint. But now technology is there to assist learning. What do we teach, when you can look up facts in two seconds flat? The answer I think is much more about challenge-based learning, where you give the pupils a high-level goal, and have the teacher support them in achieving it."</p><p>But what happens when those children leave school and encounter laptops and even desktops in businesses? Speirs isn't worried for them. Children starting at Cedars now will graduate in 2024, he points out – and any company still using desktops by then will be hopelessly behind the curve. <strong>CA</strong></p><h2>Richard Bowman – physicist<br /></h2><p>Will the iPad soon become a fixture in science labs alongside Bunsen burners, microscopes and graduated cylinders? Richard Bowman, a 24-year-old physicist doing his PhD at the University of Glasgow, reckons so. His field is optics, and in partnership with colleagues at the University of Bristol he recently developed an app that allows users to manipulate microscopic objects simply by touching the iPad's screen. Before iTweezers, Bowman employed a desktop computer and a mouse to control optical tweezers, an instrument that traps and moves microscopic particles using laser beams. Now, he does it all on his iPad.</p><p>"It's quite a natural interface," he says. "It's like you're touching the actual particle and pushing it around. We can also move particles up and down with the pinch gesture, which is hard to do with a mouse."</p><p>It may be some time before iTweezers appears on the market – "there are loads of intellectual property issues" – but Bowman has already had interest from scientists in various fields, including chemists at Glasgow University who are using it in experiments with crystals. In the meantime, he's developing a more commercially viable iPad app called LabVIEW with his colleagues in Bristol: "It puts virtual dials and sliders on the screen to let you control your experiments in the lab".</p><p>One serious limitation of the iPad, according to Bowman, is that "Apple are quite restrictive in what they'll allow to run on it. You have to register as an Apple developer and use their tools to do things." But, he adds, "I think the iPad is definitely here to stay – its capabilities are increasing all the time – and multi-touch interfaces definitely are the future. If you can control several things at once, it means you can interact with your experiment better, it can happen faster, and you can do things that you couldn't do before." <strong>KF</strong></p><h2>David Kassan – painter<br /></h2><p>When David Kassan bought an iPad last spring, his intention was to use it simply as a portfolio to show to prospective clients in the art world. Kassan, 34, is a Brooklyn-based artist who paints "really realistic lifesize figures" using oils on wood panel, and the iPad, he says, is "like a perfect art portfolio. You can adjust the colours, it's a cool thing to hold, and it's easier to update than a printout. That's the reason I got it."</p>    <span class="inline">

            </span>
<p>But on a trip to Europe last summer, Kassan started messing around with the ultra-basic Brushes app on his iPad. "I sketched people in subways and airports, and did studies of paintings in museums. I started using it as a completely portable, full-colour sketchbook. It meant I didn't have to bring watercolours or an easel with me. I could just slide it out of my bag and start using it."</p><p>Now he finds himself painting much more when out and about. "I'm an observer of everything – that's my job – and the iPad is a great tool to see things around me and be able to record them so that my eye gets keener. Also, if I'm in a museum I can do a study of the colour of a painting, not just the drawing and compositional aspects, which is all I'd really get to understand with pencil and paper."</p><p>Kassan believes that the device has improved his "real painting", but  does this mean that the paintings he does on the iPad will never qualify  as "real"? Actually, he says, "I'm working on a piece right now, a lifesize head that I'm trying to do exactly like my real paintings." Using a more advanced app called Artrage and a <a href="http://nomadbrush.com/" title="">Nomad</a> touch-screen paintbrush, he hopes "to make it as realistic as possible, print it up and sign it. I thought I might put it in my next solo show in October to see what it'll sell for." <strong>KF</strong></p><h2>Richie Hawtin – musician/ DJ<br /></h2><p>Early last year, the DJ and producer Richie Hawtin was putting together a live show to mark 20 years of Plastikman, the most prominent of his many musical alter egos. Due to its scope, the show posed a considerable challenge to the British-born techno megastar. "When you do an electronic performance, traditionally you have a mixing board with all these knobs and faders to create the sound," he explains. "For this show, each song called for a whole different set of knobs and faders."</p><p>What Hawtin needed, in order to control all those diverse environments at once, was a touch-screen device. The iPad came out in April. Within two months, Hawtin and his team had integrated it into the Plastikman performances. Six months later, they formed a company, <a href="http://liine.net/en/" title="">Liine [www.liine.net]</a>, to turn the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/apps" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Apps">apps</a> they'd developed into commercial products.</p><p>One of these apps, Griid, "allows you to navigate a musical environment that would be hundreds of screens deep if you were trying to look at it on a normal laptop. With your hand movements you can zoom from left to right, find the instrument and the melody that you want, and start, stop or modify it with a quick touch."</p><p>Another app, Kapture, "allows you to take snapshots of different states of your performance. If something amazing comes together, you can capture that moment just by touching the screen, and return to it later. Then you can then morph all these moments of the show together." Both apps interface with the popular Ableton Live sequencing software and can be used in the studio as well as onstage.</p><p>Harnessing touch-screen technology, Hawtin says, is like "following a dark path with a torch and stumbling upon new techniques. The show has evolved into something that we didn't even realise was possible." Being able to use both hands on a screen, rather than being tethered to a mouse and keyboard, "transfers a bit more of your spirit into the technology you're using".</p><p>Ever the restless techno-pioneer, Hawtin is now looking forward to future devices "that can sense not only left or right movements but how much pressure you're applying to the screen. That, as far as musicians like me are concerned, will be the next huge development." <strong>KF</strong></p>

						<h2><strong>SCREEN TEST: iPAD 2 AND THE COMPETITION RATED </strong><br /></h2><h2><strong>APPLE iPAD 2</strong></h2><p>Slimmer and lighter and quicker and cheaper (by 5%) than its predecessor, the iPad 2 has more of an "ooh" factor – and a neat addition known as a "Smart Cover" which attaches using magnets. It raises the bar for everyone else considerably. Apple has been running out of them in shops in the US and last week's opening in the UK and 24 other countries was eagerly anticipated. <strong>Rating: 5/5</strong></p><h2><strong>MOTOROLA XOOM </strong><br /></h2><p>Newly released in the US, soon to arrive in the UK. Competitive in screen size and price with the 32GB iPad, and the first with Google's new "Honeycomb" operating system. As fast as the iPad, available with 3G phone connectivity,  and comparable battery life (around 10 hours). Weaknesses? No Flash playback (it's coming), and Honeycomb's lack of tablet-scale apps. <strong>Rating: 4/5</strong></p><h2><strong>SAMSUNG GALAXY TAB </strong><br /></h2><p>The 7in screen makes it small enough to fit in a pocket, but its processor is a lot slower (its  Flash playback, on YouTube, is dreadful) and battery life closer to seven hours than the Xoom's and iPad's 10. The size is beguiling, though. Lots of apps available, though designed more for smartphones than  its screen. More expensive too; already looking like last year's model. <strong>Rating: 3/5</strong></p><h2><strong>BLACKBERRY PLAYBOOK </strong><br /></h2><p>The US release date for the 7in PlayBook from the makers of BlackBerry has finally been set at 19 April. The price will be the same as the iPad 2 and its features may well give it parity, though it is aimed at businesses and is likely to remain a niche buy. The key difference is the smaller screen size. Runs Flash natively. Weakness: may be constrained by a lack of apps, unless a rumoured ability to run Android apps is real. <strong>Rating: tbc</strong></p><h2><strong>NEXT 10IN TABLET </strong><br /></h2><p>Sets a baseline of awfulness above which every other tablet should be able to rise. Outdated version of Android, unresponsive, prone to crashing, and with dreadful battery life. No reviewer has managed a crash-free experience, and it often takes longer to charge than discharge. Woeful. <strong>Rating: 0/5</strong></p><h2><strong>AMAZON KINDLE </strong><br /></h2><p>Surprised? It's not a tablet computer as people usually think of them, but it does a couple of things – letting you read, sometimes edit, and do a little emailing really well. Battery life typically one month (seriously), and the 3G version will connect throughout its life for no extra fee. If reading books is your thing, this might be the one to consider first. <strong>Rating: 4/5</strong> <strong>CA</strong></p></div>

the guardian but this article sails very close to "we just can't stop banging on about how amazing the iPad is". A commenter points out that there is no mention of it's Flash issue, and while he's wrong because it's in the first paragraph, he's right that it should have been mentioned in the 'review' because you called out the Xoom for lacking it. Weird, and leaves you wide open to plausible accusations of bias in this case.</p><p>Some other weird comments though. For example i wasn't aware News Corp were in some kind of cahoots with Apple, probably because they aren't. News Corp launched the first news app to use Apples subscription plans, that's it. Their app is actually one of the least well designed and most flawed news apps available, as it happens. Apple had nothing to do with it's content or development.</p><p>The battery being non-replaceable is only going to be a problem if it starts showing signs of deterioration. Hasn't happened yet. Also that impacts on the thickness. Furthermore i see other manufacturers adopting the sealed in battery now. Any bitching about them doing it?</p><p>I thought it was sweet that iggy assumes his experiences speak for the tastes of the world. Because none of his mates have iPads they must only be for mugs and it's reported popularity must be either lies, marketing or the fantastical delusion of apple cultists I suppose? Couldn't possibly be because he just happens to have friends that dont fancy one and therefore didn't buy one? </p><p>Affront: if i were you I'd save my money and not buy an iPad. Just because some other people have one and you read an article about how people that have one like it doesnt mean you should throw rational nature financial judgement out the window and join in. It might not even be suited to you. I'd go try one and decide then.</p><p>Finally, as cringingly heavy on arselicking the iPad as this article is, it's no churnalism. That word is reserved for when journalists paste in practically the entire contents of a press release word for word then stick their own byline on it.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment" class="recommend" onclick="recommendComment(10125580);return false;">Recommend?</a> (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10125580">9</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10125580"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10125580" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10125580" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10125604"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/meestersmeeth" title="User profile page">meestersmeeth</a> <p class="date">27 March 2011 9:56AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>Also, there's clearly a word missing in the headline: "Why the iPad and it's mark a new stage in computing"?</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment" class="recommend" onclick="recommendComment(10125604);return false;">Recommend?</a> (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10125604">2</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10125604"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10125604" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10125604" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10125606"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/09/02/cta_262190_10/ee20eb59-5eb0-4502-939c-5a9ebe2b77c8/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/musorah" title="User profile page">musorah</a> <p class="date">27 March 2011 9:56AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>One of the points missed by many is that it is hard to find people using non-existent products. Where are the legions queueing up to buy Android tablets? When I visit one major high street retailer I might find two lonely tablets, neither of which is working because the sim for the phone hasn't been installed, and the larger one costs more than the equivalent iPad.</p><p>The sales stats for tablet computing devices and mobile phones, the expanding, cutting edge of the technology world, tell a different story than those of desktops and laptops. </p><p>Need more storage? Look to the cloud, then you can work between all of your devices. Flash? Use sites that use HTML 5. One of the reasons for the 10 hour battery life is that processes, like Flash, that inefficiently use resources haven't been supported. Need a keyboard for easier typing? Buy a Bluetooth keyboard. </p><p>No device can be all things to all people. Apple's philosophy is to sell consumer goods. if you want to get your hands dirty and play around inside the engine, fix it yourself and customise it or turn it into a "hot rod", then Apple isn't the platform for you. If you want to use the device for a purpose it is fit for, put it down when you are done and take it to the repairman when it is broken, then Apple and the iPad is for you.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment" class="recommend" onclick="recommendComment(10125606);return false;">Recommend?</a> (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10125606">15</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10125606"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10125606" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10125606" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10125614"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2011/01/07/liberalcynic/6313f301-5824-4e6f-8901-ec2adc04fab2/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/liberalcynic" title="User profile page">liberalcynic</a> <p class="date">27 March 2011 9:58AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>This isn't an article, it's a commercial.

However this article is truly terrible. It reads just like an advertorial. I'm one of the people who believe that tablets are the future of personal computing as it's a far more intuitive way of accessing information. Fair enough the writer can't control what the users say about their iPads but there caan be a little balanced critique about their comments. for example when they mature android multitouch tablets are probably a better fit for scientific applications due to their openness. Also how can the xoom not currently having flash be listed as a negative when the iPad will never have it due largely to ideological and commercial decisions rather then user choice and needs (why apple won't let the user decide if they want flash on their device or not is beyond me). The other concern I have is that if the iPad became the dominant tablet and tablet became the dominate way of computing Apples control of what is allowed on the device is a real issue. Imagine if Microsoft could control what is and isn't allowed to run on windows. A little balanced criticism would be nice guardian.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment" class="recommend" onclick="recommendComment(10125662);return false;">Recommend?</a> (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10125662">75</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10125662"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10125662" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10125662" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10125670"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/11/07/alfredooo/86e55ecb-0301-4b21-94b7-656e71f361e5/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/alfredooo" title="User profile page">alfredooo</a> <p class="date">27 March 2011 10:04AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>replace the word "i-pad" with "tablet PC" and re-read. </p><p>this is yet another shameless Apple PR piece run by the Guardian, it serves to simply undermine the publications credibility even further.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment" class="recommend" onclick="recommendComment(10125670);return false;">Recommend?</a> (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10125670">77</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10125670"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10125670" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10125670" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10125673"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/DavidoM" title="User profile page">DavidoM</a> <p class="date">27 March 2011 10:04AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p><i>But the iPads, with their simplified approach to filing (you can't choose where to save a file), have made at least part of his life much simpler.</i></p><p>Can I introduce you to a world with hundreds and thousands of files with share drives.

It would have been better to have interviewed a wider range of people, some of whom have jobs that are not suited to a tablet computer. Additionally it would have been useful to see other tablets available in the UK used for work-related activities, such as the Advent Vega and the NEXT Tablet as well as the A1CS X220, the Archos, the EP121-1A019M, the aPad, etc. Of course finding those who use these devices for work might be a challenge but it would result in a more 'balanced' article.</p><p>The Flash issue is really not important. Flash on a mobile device is currently problematic due to poor performance and its impact on battery life.

It just seems that way. </p><p>Give a gadget to any journalist, anywhere, along with the utterances of “experts “(and in this case, evangelists) and the result is “Ooo, shiny.” </p><p>The problem with the technology churn is that most reviewers, experts, and evangelists just don’t get it. Where “it” is the real world. This is true of the UK IT curriculum in schools and its endearing belief in magic pixie dust: if children use a computer in the classroom (of any type) they are learning how to live in the modern world. </p><p>Take for example: </p><blockquote><p>Children starting at Cedars now will graduate in 2024, he points out – and any company still using desktops by then will be hopelessly behind the curve.</p></blockquote><p>. </p><p>This is the implicit or explicit theology of every Guardian review of anything that glitters (although this quote is form one of their “real people”).</p><p>This stuff is so cool, everyone will be using it and the great god commerce will adopt it because it’s so damn cool. </p><p>30+ years of moving in and out of companies as an IT services person leaves me with the objective reality: companies are still using 10 year old crap - MS XP is still the most used corporate OS at the desk top – and in some cases they are still using 20 year old crap. By 2024 they’ll be up to Windows 7. Possibly. </p><p>There is not only a massive capital investment in retooling an enterprise for iPads or Android or whatever, it’s an extraordinarily non-compliant and low security thing to do. Knowing where a file is on an iPad doesn’t put it where it should be – somewhere else, preferably duplicated as well as encrypted.</p><p>Successive “ooo shiny” decades has led us to far too much trust in technology. Giving it to children makes this problem worse, if not delivered with training in the taming of the beast. Or the knowledge that only phones, iPads cash registers are touch-screen and they will at some point in their lives have to type or for that matter, think about how they use the thing before wielding it – like any old hammer. </p><p>Of course the iPad (and tablets) will work for some. But a bit of real-world reality is required to understand its limits. </p><p>In business (and in consumer land for that matter), an iPad is a limited (very limited) functional adjunct. It is predicated on a theory that is only true in a limited sense: that the user orbits a big ‘ol ball of readily accessible data, through a universally always-on communications medium, and that the data has already been processed by one application or another and is ready to be fed through the furry pipes of Apple’s application plumbing to the business end. </p><p>When we achieve that nirvana, we’ll have a paradigm shift. The iPads problem is everyone thinks we already have because technology Guardianista’s fail to look past “ooo shiney”. In 2024, unless we’re lucky, half the data will have fallen off – never mind the gilded framed iPaddy window on it.</p><p>The examples in the this one sided conversation above are people who do a few things really well on an iPad. </p><p>My first portable computing device had wheels, and my first mobile phone forced me to buy a backpack.</p><p>An iPad requires me to have to a backpack (I still have to do all the things it doesn't). Great, I’ve lost the wheels. And under the slings and arrows of outrageous technology, possibly my marbles. </p><p>I don’t mind so much about the keyboard. It’ that damn real world thing again. I type like shit on every computing device known to man. Predictive text just adds to the smorgasbord of typos I can select from. Pecking out e-mails on an iPad simply adds to the chances that one day I will inadvertently tell a customer to eff off. Does anyone really think that companies will replace call centre workstations with tablets? Predictive text in one’s native tongue is enough of a struggle, predictive text in multi-language environments is a gilded machine for throwing turds. </p><p>For the iPad to be a business success requires lower-level minions who use real computers to tee it all up so that the higher echelons can whip out their iPads in meetings. Any child using an iPad in education is going to get a nasty shock when they realize that they don’t get one of those, they get one of these fixed-gear digital bicycles. </p><p>So, no paradigm shift in an iPad. Guardian pundits think every incremental advance is a new paradigm. </p><p>So to help them going forward: </p><p>- Flushing toilets is a paradigm shift. </p><p>- A hand held digital porta-cabin is still a porta-cabin.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment" class="recommend" onclick="recommendComment(10126140);return false;">Recommend?</a> (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10126140">21</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10126140"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10126140" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10126140" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10126236"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/09/02/cta_262190_21/6619e12d-8b55-4515-8357-52958f5c3b5f/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/bcnman" title="User profile page">bcnman</a> <p class="date">27 March 2011 11:06AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>I think I am going to be sick.

(17 hours vs 13.5 for fully charged, to full drained, to fully charged). <br/>This is an issue that Apple needs to sort if iPads are going to be used full time in areas like medicine, especially if it's to be a shared resource.</p><blockquote><p>Weaknesses? No Flash playback (it's coming)</p></blockquote><p>Isn't this a weakness of the iPad(2) also? Plus, there is a beta version of Flash already available for the Xoom.</p><blockquote><p>Frasier Speirs – teacher</p><p>"Nobody has lost a file for a year now," says Fraser Speirs.</p></blockquote><p>This sounds more like a function of poor network/user setup from the schools IT dept along with a lack of knowledge, lack of software and poor teaching skills. <br/>Was equipping the whole school with iPads more cost effective than a bit of network knowledge from somewhere? </p><blockquote><p>"Previously, we taught technology just for business needs – Excel, PowerPoint.</p></blockquote><p>And why would using a tablet be any different. Business still needs those skills. Spreadsheets are one of the most powerful pieces of software available and many, many businesses are inherently reliant on them. Whilst they may like to think that the world in 2024 will consist of businesses solely using tablets, it's likely that if they do, they'll still be using spreadsheets and powerpoint presentations on them. The skills are no different, just the way you perform the inputs. <br/>In fact, that teacher really should spend the summer trailing a few different people to see how IT is used in big business. There are many different ways to present data, but very few ways to input it.</p><p>One wonders where Margaret Manning actually created her presentation. </p><p>I presume Skype is wi-fi only on iOS? And even then. Surely Margaret knows you can pay to be able to call landlines and mobiles from Skype.

I don't know if you've noticed, but there happens to be a lot of articles about the Nintendo DS at the moment. I haven't researched this - I use a technique that I like to call "thinking" to decide not to read an article in which I have no interest; I can explain how this works if any of you are interested - but I wonder whether those articles are drenched with comments about The Guardian having a commercial relationship with Nintendo or how the DS sucks because it doesn't have Flash.</p><p>Others before me have also pointed out that all of the negative comments are self-defeating, because they simply drive traffic to the article. So the best way to influence the future direction of The Guardian's tech reporting is to not click on an article about Apple or the iPad and not comment on it. Just a thought.

(17 hours vs 13.5 for fully charged, to full drained, to fully charged). <br/>This is an issue that Apple needs to sort if iPads are going to be used full time in areas like medicine, especially if it's to be a shared resource.</p></blockquote><p>BRILLIANT! This is the best example of 'clutching frantically at straws' I've ever seen. hey folks listen up! The iPad's amazing battery life is USELESS because a different tablet charges up 20% faster!</p><p>Mate, with a ten hour lifespan (and that's if you cane it from start to finish - in reality it will easily last over a day) any sensible person will put it on to charge at night and always start the day with 100%, so your point may be a fact but it's also kinda moot.</p><blockquote><p>Isn't [lack of Flash] a weakness of the iPad(2) also? Plus, there is a beta version of Flash already available for the Xoom.</p></blockquote><p>You're damn right it's a 'weakness' of the iPad and Charles Arthur shot himself in the face with both barrels of a <i>faux pas </i>shotgun by neglecting to call the iPad for it while slagging off the Xoom for it. Having said that, you'll note that even 5 years after Apple first released a device that didn't allow Flash, Adobe still haven't got beyond providing a beta release of Flash for mobile devices. In the meantime so many leaps forward in HTML5 have been made.</p><p><i>This sounds more like a function of poor network/user setup from the schools IT dept along with a lack of knowledge, lack of software and poor teaching skills. Was equipping the whole school with iPads more cost effective than a bit of network knowledge from somewhere?</i></p><p>Presumably it was, yes, <i>because that's what they did</i>. Also presumably, it requires not having to teach any kids how to use it, always a bonus.

But, leaving aside how you get the applications on the iPad in the first place, who writes the applications and what do you need to write them?</p><p>Of course you need to be a trained software developer and you need a 'proper' Mac computer (laptop or desk top) - you can't do it on a Windows machine.</p><p>In a business world it's no doubt great to use as a tool to show pre-prepared presenations, but how do you prepare those presentations? Again you need a proper computer.</p><p>It's also a handy gadget for the home user - surfing the net (except you have no choice of browser - funny that Microsoft were hammered for this and yet Apple have no problem), reading a book, playing music, watching a film, etc. But what happens when you want to do some real writing? No access to Word or Open Office writer. How do save it? how do you share it? Back to the lap top again.</p><p>Some clown mentioned cloud storage if you ran out of storage space on your (non-upgradeable) iPad. No way - I will not, under any circumstances, place my personal documents on a server off my machine and out of my control.</p><p>In short it's an expensive toy, useful in some ways, brilliant in a few but still a toy.

Another is as an additional showroom tool: having one product in the showroom then if the customer wants to see different colours or finishes, grab the iPad and show them.</p></blockquote><p>You seem to have mixed up two entirely applications of technology. </p><p>I’ll take your word for the former, warehouse, application. But it’s extremely difficult to see any business value for iPads in a warehouse environment. For starters they are far too fragile. Secondly, they require significant adaption to any application (within extremely tight constraints imposed by Apple) at the back-end. Third, warehouse and supply line technology is highly integrated within its basic functions for a hand held device: UPC scanner, local caching of data, and direct access to (redundant) access points, etc. - all directly integrated to the "pick, label and convey" system. Fourth, an iPad is designed to sit on the internet’s edge, not secured enterprise networks. </p><p>Of course you can use an iPad in that sort of environment using a straight https interface that runs on the iPads browser, but why would you if that's all you've got? The purpose built interfaces are a fraction of the price and do exactly what you want them do with only minimal change to back-end applications they are designed to work with. </p><p>As for the latter, that technology works much better on a touch screen flat panel and has been around for several years. An iPad in a showroom is just eye candy – and easily nickable eye candy at that. Whilst the application is plausible, the additional value iPad brings is not. A drawback common between your former example and the latter one, is the iPad’s expense and difficulty handling custom applications. So, one assumes, this application is also an html based interface. </p><p>What your examples highlight is a key difference between iPads, iPhones and other tablet and phone operating systems: </p><p>Apple “I” anything forces you to adapt to <i>it&lt;/it&gt;. It’s competitors (more or less) allow you to modify it to <i>you</i>. So, in a showroom or a warehouse you change your business way of working to work with Apple’s iPad, or you use something else (a purpose designed technology in a warehouse, or something you can change) to work the best way for your business. Since the former is a crap way of buying and adapting technology for business and a bad risk (if Apple changes things – as they do – you have to change again), its hard to see how either of your examples (if actually existing) are not deployed at the behest fo an internal (to the company) entusiast who also has the power to spend money with little procedural oversight. The road to IT hell is paved with the wreckage of crap implementations brought about by the best understanding of a new paradigm that an executive could get from two paragraphs in a PR written in-flight magazine backed up by an over enthusiastic corporate nerd with a new toy and no real appreciation for what the thing will do to people doing real jobs outside the lab. This is why this utopian idea that a well managed business will adopt iPads or any other latest cool thing as a new paradigm is nonsense. Of course, people in business will use them for any number of reasons – including the cool factor – but they won’t ever be a new way of doing business in themselves. Not that I think the "mines better" argument holds any more water. You need to work just as hard to make Linux or Android useful as anything else. Unless you are reading the Guardian. That works anywhere on anything. Sort of. A major benefit of using an iPad to read the Guardian (other than that sense of superiority) is that the annoying mouse over ads that ring fence the content have no mouse to over..</i></p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment" class="recommend" onclick="recommendComment(10127665);return false;">Recommend?</a> (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10127665">6</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10127665"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10127665" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10127665" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10127678"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/rustyschwinnToo" title="User profile page">rustyschwinnToo</a> <p class="date">27 March 2011 1:47PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>Bollards.

It has an utterly ridiculous battery life and its screen is just marvellous. It will make sense for some businesses or schools or colleges to spend money on licences and produce entire collections of books on the Kindle or similar e-readers. Don't want to carry around a 900 page medical textbook? Kindle.</p><p>It's a simple, easy choice. Why is it a simple choice? The Kindle does something nothing else so far as done. It has been designed for one thing. Reading. Someone, somewhere thought "right, so what does a reader want?"</p><p>A reader would want:</p><p>- to read at their own leisure<br/>- to be able to put a book down and pick it back up again<br/>- to read as close an analogy to paper and print as possible<br/>- to be able to read with one or both hands<br/>- to be able to annotate things; ask anyone who uses textbooks how long they last without annotations</p><p>The Kindle also does other things (MP3s, personal data storage etc) but it does the one thing it's really, really well. That efficiency is often not valued by designers these days. They don't sit down and ask what their primary end user wants to use their device for.</p><p>iPads and similar tablets are a classic example of design without a purpose. People call PCs as "a PC" but there are thousands of configurations of PCs, from your processor in a box which is essentially little more than a mainboard, some RAM, input, output and a processor designed to be slaved into a server architecture, through to your high end gaming machine which is essentially a mini supercomputer. Each one of these can be designed for a different task, or many tasks, or all tasks.</p><p>Tablet computers do not seem to have been designed with a purpose other than "well people like smartphones so let's make one bigger." It just does a lot of things very badly and a couple of things quite well due to the touch screen. It hasn't been designed like the Kindle, where the designers have genuinely considered how the device will be used.</p><p>It's also crippled by Apple's App Store.</p><p>The market's pretty much wide open for MS to crush it with a Windows based tablet, able to run everything your home computer does.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment" class="recommend" onclick="recommendComment(10127741);return false;">Recommend?</a> (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10127741">50</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10127741"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10127741" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10127741" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10127864"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/11/17/LostJohnny/d8b009c3-2d26-4941-a213-82507d142316/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/LostJohnny" title="User profile page">LostJohnny</a> <p class="date">27 March 2011 2:13PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>This read like an advert for an Apple!

Having a means of capturing stock movements at the point that they are being moved is key to this.</p><p>@rustySchwinnToo makes a number of assumptions about my knowledge (or lack of it, eg "if these examples actually exist") which I'll let pass. You have a different idea of the iPad's utility with these examples, which is fair enough. My experience is different.</p><p>There are already Apps for the iPad which enable secure connections to databases, so a web browser is not required. The security angle of iPad use is not trivial but can be managed to an acceptable level. And if a small or medium-sized enterprise already has a database built to manage its business, then purchasing one iPad to enable stock control, plus spending a small amount on making the (relatively few) changes to the database, becomes pretty attractive.</p><p>Likewise, the showroom. Yes, you can have a large flat-screen computer. But I thought your angle was one of price; an iPad would be cheaper. Plus the iPad can interrogate the business database to check directly on stock. It can create the order. So in this context it can do all of the things that the flat-screen could do, but more cheaply. And more intimately (for want of a better word) because the interaction is direct with the customer next to the item being discussed. </p><p>One thing that your response has made me consider is that both my quoted examples, plus others I didn't mention, are for organisations which already have a database to which to link additional iPad-driven functionality. It may be the case that creating something from scratch may be more expensive than alternatives; I simply don't know.

I can only endorse the criticisms leveled at it and also the disappointing lack of serious investigation shown. A couple of points:<br/>1. Businesses are not, and will not, be a niche market for Tablets. From my experience working with very large corporations they are all investigating the practicality of tablets and of course the reason they focus on the ipad is because it has had the market to itself for a long time and Apple are working hard to promote them before the onslaught of credible alternatives<br/>2. Don't forget that the single most important application that businesses require (and the most commercially sensitive) is email. iPad is not (yet) a credible entrant into secure corporate email and of course blackberry is.<br/>3. The idea that the tablet revolution (which will happen) is only about the ipad is woefully ignorant. The ipad is the first but surely not the last entry into this market.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment" class="recommend" onclick="recommendComment(10127979);return false;">Recommend?</a> (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10127979">35</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10127979"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10127979" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10127979" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10128009"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/happenstanceradio" title="User profile page">happenstanceradio</a> <p class="date">27 March 2011 2:31PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>Netbooks are better than iPads, unless you are an artist.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment" class="recommend" onclick="recommendComment(10128009);return false;">Recommend?</a> (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10128009">16</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10128009"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10128009" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10128009" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10128045"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/22/ThePaladin/79421959-b5e8-447d-b076-66b8234a545e/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/ThePaladin" title="User profile page">ThePaladin</a> <p class="date">27 March 2011 2:35PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <blockquote><p>Yes, that's the point.

In addition to this, point of sale machines are vastly underused for the purposes of stock control and if properly used, are fully capable of keeping track of stock for small businesses as well.</p><p>As for the showroom example, you can build a workable flat screen computer capable of doing ten times as much an iPad is capable of with a screen several times the size for in the region of a hundred quid.</p><p>It's not difficult, really. You are going to need desktop computers regardless of how much you think the iPad is capable of. That means the iPad, in that form, becomes quite simply a display machine.

Since Samsung announced prices last week matching the 10.1 with the iPad2 (undercutting slightly with the 8.9), you might even have felt compelled to give it a matching 5/5. </p><p>That would also have allowed you the to raise the significant (and in your "tablet review" completely ignored) question about the 'ideal' form factor; since whilst many have felt the 7" tablets just a bit small, this new 8.9" screen (and lightest tablet yet) size has been received by some reviewers as "feeling <i>very </i>comfortable to hold" and may well turn out to be the "sweetest spot."

"<b>I realised I could comfortably do emails</b>, download a book to read, watch a film, whatever," she says. "There's no other device that you can do that with. You certainly can't read with a laptop in bed."</p><p>Manning, 50, is the founder and chief executive of Reading Room, a London-based web development agency employing 170 people. She takes the iPad with her to client meetings and presentations: "It's got a wow factor," she says. <b>&gt;"I did a presentation that I ran off it, and all the people in the room went, 'Ooh',"&lt;/b she recalls, adding: "They were all bankers." To Manning, the iPad's chief virtue is its versatility. She can carry it in her bag to go to clients, <b>check work emails </b>in a coffee shop or train, and then take it to a bar later and kill some time playing a game. It's become her laptop, TV screen, iPod and iPhone. "It's adaptive to today's digital age. You can create and consume content in a different way." </b></p></blockquote><p><b> this is a chief executve who only seems to need to read email or make people go "ooh". how does she work with data? how does she work with a balance sheet, or a revenue forecast or a manpower projection? how does she track operating expenses or asset depreciation or any of the other key business metrics? a business leader who doesn't use excel or a business reporting tool. wow. i am genuinely puzzled as to how she does her job with just an ipad.</b></p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment" class="recommend" onclick="recommendComment(10128574);return false;">Recommend?</a> (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10128574">34</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10128574"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10128574" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10128574" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10128644"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/11/08/JaitcH/060496ed-ae04-4a75-aa7d-cb10ed491864/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/JaitcH" title="User profile page">JaitcH</a> <p class="date">27 March 2011 3:53PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p><b>The weekly love letter from Charles Arthur to the <i>Church of Jobs</i> in Cupertino</b></p><p>It is hard to believe that an editor even reads this trash.

I don't remember this sort of hostility to laptops when they came out despite the fact that they are always underpowered and limited in comparison to the potential of a contemporaneous desktop (in terms of upgradeability etc). </p><p>The iPad and other tablets may not match a laptop in all areas but if they are a genuinely mould breaking tech then they won't, will they? They'll do things differently. There is a rigidity of thinking expressed in these comments that is often amusing. It'll be interesting to see where the tablet market is at in 5 years time and how many of the commentators are eating their words.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment" class="recommend" onclick="recommendComment(10129297);return false;">Recommend?</a> (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10129297">2</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10129297"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10129297" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10129297" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10129400"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/12/17/purplesunrise1999/c2072dc9-9536-4f44-9807-af760ea07446/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/purplesunrise1999" title="User profile page">purplesunrise1999</a> <p class="date">27 March 2011 5:19PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p class="moderated">This comment was removed by a moderator because it didn't abide by our <a href='http://www.guardian.co.uk/community-standards'>community standards</a>.

Charles' latest contributions as such, the mere titles of which amply demonstrate his razor sharp range of focus, his rosy green wit and wisdom. Charlie slices through the complex world of technology like Occam, providing us, the previously confused, only the simplest and purest solution possible from within the jungle of manufacturer multitude. </p><blockquote><p>#1 - How the iPad revolution has transformed working lives </p><p>#2 - Thousands queue for iPad 2 at Apple stores as big business use forecast</p><p>#3 - While you were sleeping.. Australians end long wait for iPad 2</p><p>#4 - iPad 2 queues start 33 hours early as demand expected to beat supply</p></blockquote><p>- Admittedly, none of the above even begin to approach the high standards occasionally awaited, nay, demanded by connesiours of Mr Arthurs work. A `review` of a competitors tablet, subtly squeezing in superfluous use of the word "iPad" 28 times for example, all the while unfavourably comparing the nominally under review device to an (at that time) non-existent iPad 2. Or, among my own personal favourites, the Asus launch, in which our intrepid author, having been somewhat puzzlingly dispatched to Las Vegas (or somewhere) to cover an unfortunately otherwise Apple-less event, complains they are all a bunch of foreigners incapable of even striding across the stage like Jobs does, the remainder being thus so boring, he basically nods off in print. </p><p>Charles is, as noted, an Apple Man. As Hobbits were to Tolkein, as waifs were to Dickens, Charles is indeed an entirely unashamed and unapologetic Apple Man, there is no other, there can only be one. Like Thatcher, this Charlies not for turning. Charles is an Apple Fan, thus, must we all be Apple Fans, for The Grauniad, there is, quite simply, no alternative. For the casual reader, perusal of any of Mr Arthurs Grauniad Apple articles (all of them) in search of any semblance whatsoever of such basic journalistic principles as integrity, balance and lack of bias, this indeed remains a fruitless task, despite the otherwise bounteous abundance of such within this august body of work. </p><p>The iPad 2 is here, this resurrection, this second coming, this revolutionary evolution, this sea-tide of shifting pardigrams, this entire bollox will continue to be extensively drooled over in Charlies Grauniad App-reciation Section, all the way through <b>The Pad, Part II's</b> never at question stunningly successful launch and rollout stage. The minor inconvenience for us inifdels being, Mr Arthur obviously regards iPad launches as ongoing events and, as such, a Festival of Celebration of product purity and gloriousness to be continued, right up until the next, all too inevitable, Cupertino Pad Launch. </p><p>Charles Arthur is the Guardian's technology editor.

Now that desktops are very cheap and easily repairable from extremely cheap parts I don't see iPads or anything else replacing these machines any time soon or ever.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment" class="recommend" onclick="recommendComment(10129601);return false;">Recommend?</a> (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10129601">1</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10129601"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10129601" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10129601" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10129704"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/09/02/cta_262190_21/6619e12d-8b55-4515-8357-52958f5c3b5f/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/bcnman" title="User profile page">bcnman</a> <p class="date">27 March 2011 5:54PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>jenni23<br/>Now that is totally random commenting on an article on Pizza and iBad and pointing out the inherent flaws of them as cultural icons.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment" class="recommend" onclick="recommendComment(10129704);return false;">Recommend?</a> (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10129704">1</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10129704"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10129704" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10129704" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10129727"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/23/Polymorph/b8ce9238-1fd5-4504-9031-6bb45fd66ce6/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/Polymorph" title="User profile page">Polymorph</a> <p class="date">27 March 2011 5:57PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>printerink</p><p>I don't entirely disagree with your slightly cynical view of the laptop trend but there are of course many occasions (which i suspect you are provocatively ignoring...) when a portable device has the advantage over a desktop.

Apple products and yet it is equally true that they always equate 'e-reader' with Kindle (and commenters alike, as above). Some love-in with Amazon going on there, too. There are OTHER e-readers on the market as well. I think Kindle have only a 1% market share higher than the Sony (and just like Apple, Amazon tie you into only being able to buy product from them afterwards) but you never hear mention of other brands. It's annoying, just saying.</p><p>And, btw, my husband works in IT in education and is a real Mac hater. As he says, unless you're gonna be a designer or muso you're not equipping the kids with real world IT skills at all.

You all don't get it, do you? Look at what is the most viewed technology article in the last 24 hours. This one. By opening the article and, worse, by adding your bilious comments, you're only perpetuating articles such as this. The Guardian doesn't care whether the traffic is generated through love or hate: it just wants the traffic. </p><p>Your best policy is to keep quiet. Or go to another paper's web-site. Oh, hang on, they're all full of iPad stuff right now too, aren't they. (For example Telegraph, front page, hot topic: iPad 2.) Hmm, where's my bucket of sand...</p><p>@weissrabbit: sorry to be boring, but you can weave any supposedly-objective thesis out of cherry-picked data. Well done for listing four articles by a co-author of this piece that neatly fit your stance. Why not now list his last 50 articles and let us form our own view on the biases or otherwise of the author. And to be truly objective, you need to look at the content, not at the headline, because the author rarely writes that.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment" class="recommend" onclick="recommendComment(10130733);return false;">Recommend?</a> (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10130733">4</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10130733"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10130733" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10130733" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10130995"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/RayOfBlue" title="User profile page">RayOfBlue</a> <p class="date">27 March 2011 8:39PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <blockquote><p>meestersmeeth<br/>27 March 2011 9:53AM<br/>I have to say I generally dont have a problem with the coverage of Apple in the guardian</p></blockquote><p><br/>Get outta town!</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment" class="recommend" onclick="recommendComment(10130995);return false;">Recommend?</a> (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10130995">13</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10130995"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10130995" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10130995" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10131069"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/RayOfBlue" title="User profile page">RayOfBlue</a> <p class="date">27 March 2011 8:47PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <blockquote><p>Frasier Speirs – teacher</p><p>"Nobody has lost a file for a year now," says Fraser Speirs.

(17 hours vs 13.5 for fully charged, to full drained, to fully charged). <br/>This is an issue that Apple needs to sort if iPads are going to be used full time in areas like medicine, especially if it's to be a shared resource.</p><p>BRILLIANT! This is the best example of 'clutching frantically at straws' I've ever seen. hey folks listen up! The iPad's amazing battery life is USELESS because a different tablet charges up 20% faster!<br/></p></blockquote><p>I don't believe is said the iPads battery life was 'USELESS' at all. In fact, I know I didn't. It's there in black and white.</p><blockquote><p><br/>Mate, with a ten hour lifespan (and that's if you cane it from start to finish - in reality it will easily last over a day) any sensible person will put it on to charge at night and always start the day with 100%, so your point may be a fact but it's also kinda moot.</p></blockquote><p>For any normal user yes. But if you're talking about business application, shared resources and full time use, it most definitely isn't 'moot'.</p><blockquote><p><br/>Isn't [lack of Flash] a weakness of the iPad(2) also? Plus, there is a beta version of Flash already available for the Xoom.</p><p>You're damn right it's a 'weakness' of the iPad and Charles Arthur shot himself in the face with both barrels of a faux pas shotgun by neglecting to call the iPad for it while slagging off the Xoom for it. Having said that, you'll note that even 5 years after Apple first released a device that didn't allow Flash, Adobe still haven't got beyond providing a beta release of Flash for mobile devices. In the meantime so many leaps forward in HTML5 have been made.<br/></p></blockquote><p>Flash works just fine and isn't a beta on any normal mobile device. It's a beta for honeycomb. As Adobe actively work with Google, I expect this to rapidly change. </p><blockquote><p><br/>This sounds more like a function of poor network/user setup from the schools IT dept along with a lack of knowledge, lack of software and poor teaching skills. Was equipping the whole school with iPads more cost effective than a bit of network knowledge from somewhere?</p><p>Presumably it was, yes, because that's what they did. Also presumably, it requires not having to teach any kids how to use it, always a bonus. Kinda levels the playing field.<br/></p></blockquote><p>You're presuming quite a bit here. I would hazard a guess that the teacher isn't very good and fudged some numbers and pushed the 'wow' factor angle.</p><p>From a distinctly selfish point of view though, I'm fairly sure those kids won't be competing for my job in 20 years time, because they won't have the foggiest.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment" class="recommend" onclick="recommendComment(10132560);return false;">Recommend?</a> (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10132560">6</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10132560"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10132560" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10132560" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10132870"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/kcr123" title="User profile page">kcr123</a> <p class="date">28 March 2011 12:50AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <blockquote><p>These were not gadget freaks or latte-quaffing Hoxton-based web designers, as some imagine iPad users to be.

His is perhaps the most lucid voice in a sea of guff that generally passes off as tech punditry. The quote the author provides comes from this excellent piece by Horace: <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2011/03/08/whats-a-post-pc-device/" rel="nofollow">http://www.asymco.com/2011/03/08/whats-a-post-pc-device/</a>.</p><p>The title of his blog, Asymco, refers to 'asymmetry of business models'. Fellow commentators, I would respectfully recommend reading of Horace's blog and the <b>well thought out comments</b>. Unfortunately there is quite a lot of uninformed commentary amongst some of Guardian's readership.</p><p>If you are genuinely interested in how business models, strategy and technology are intertwined, and how the 'post-PC' market is shaping up due to disruption, the following articles are a good place to start:</p><p><a href="http://www.asymco.com/2011/01/19/unforeseeable-growth-analyst-failure-on-ipad-as-indicator-of-disruptive-change/" rel="nofollow">http://www.asymco.com/2011/01/19/unforeseeable-growth-analyst-failure-on-ipad-as-indicator-of-disruptive-change/</a><br/><a href="http://www.asymco.com/2011/03/04/flummoxed-again/" rel="nofollow">http://www.asymco.com/2011/03/04/flummoxed-again/</a>.</p><p>Lastly, another gem from Horace: </p><blockquote><p>'I sometimes use the phrase “unforeseeable growth” to describe the kind of growth that not even the most knowledgeable observers of a market can predict.

Apologies for the repost.]</p><p>Great to see Horace Dediu of Asymco finally being recognised and quoted in the mainstream press. His is perhaps the most lucid voice in a sea of guff that generally passes off as tech punditry. The quote the author provides comes from this excellent piece by Horace: <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2011/03/08/whats-a-post-pc-device/" rel="nofollow">What’s a Post-PC device?</a>.</p><p>The title of his blog, Asymco, refers to 'asymmetry of business models'. Fellow commentators, I would respectfully recommend reading of Horace's blog and the well thought out comments. Unfortunately there is quite a lot of uninformed commentary amongst some of Guardian's readership.</p><p>If you are genuinely interested in how business models, strategy and technology are intertwined, and how the 'post-PC' market is shaping up due to disruption, the following articles are a good place to start:</p><p><a href="http://www.asymco.com/2011/01/19/unforeseeable-growth-analyst-failure-on-ipad-as-indicator-of-disruptive-change/" rel="nofollow">Unforeseeable growth: Analyst failure on iPad as indicator of disruptive change</a><br/><a href="http://www.asymco.com/2011/03/04/flummoxed-again/" rel="nofollow">Flummoxed, again</a>.</p><p>Lastly, another gem from Horace:</p><blockquote><p>'I sometimes use the phrase “unforeseeable growth” to describe the kind of growth that not even the most knowledgeable observers of a market can predict.

Young(ish), international, gadget loving, self employed and working in the creative industries. I do everything expected of a good Apple customer but pose in the window seat of a coffee shop, and I'm a happy owner of both the iPhone and iPad. When Jobs develops a new shiny bauble he has me and those like me firmly in mind, and that's fine by me. </p><p>Even so, just effing shush. The limitations of the iPad far outweigh its positive attributes, and claiming otherwise is plainly silly. It's fun. You can read books and watch films on it. You can play Sparkle HD while having a crap, and I love it for that (my pre-iPad toilet visits were comparatively uneventful). I'm a big fan, but anyone who claims the iPad increases their productivity, allows them to be more creative or offers pretty much anything not currently offered by a laptop is either a) telling stories, b) a bit dim, or c) not doing very challenging work. You CAN "do emails, download a book to read, watch a film, whatever" in bed with a laptop, as anyone who has ever seen or used a laptop is well aware. iPads help farmers diagnose ailing crops by comparing them with pictures? Great. You can do the same thing with, y'know, pictures, and at the low, low price of bugger all. </p><p>Nothing here is new, and when you turn away from the smooth shiny thing for a few seconds that becomes obvious. It's fun, and looks cool, and it's a bit lighter than a laptop because it doesn't have a keyboard and it's not very powerful. It isn't wheel 2.0. It's just... I don't know, a thing that we want because we're bored and a bit dense and easily distracted, and we have a vague idea that this will fill some undefined hole in our silly, rudderless little lives. </p><p>When I read articles like this they make me feel like an idiot for buying an iPad. They make me want to pick up a shovel and get a job that makes me sweat. They make me embarrassed to be seen with it, and I wish you'd just... shush.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment"

I really hope you received a lot of money and a few more freebie iPad's for your trouble.</p><p>I have an iPad 1 and I want an iPad 2. They are great devices, but mine will not replace my desktop or macbook when I need to do some serious work. I bought it because I wanted it - I'm not desperately hunting around to find a use or do I feel the need to justify the purchase (I can afford it). </p><p>The iPad sits in between what I do with my Blackberry and my macbook. In fact, I rarely take the iPad outside the house - it's fantastic for surfing, placing bets and reading emails - I'm not really interested in games, although I have bought a few for my kids. It's perfect for what I want (not need), particularly when I cant be bothered to move off the sofa, but it hasn't changed my life!</p><p>Lastly, I work in the banking industry (you can probably tell from my DNS) and if I went to a meeting and someone pulled out an iPad I would ask them to put it away. You cannot use them for quick note taking during a meeting. I'd be wondering whether they were listening or just fiddling - Blackberrys and iPhones in meetings are bad enough.

The question he should have asked is how do you get the image out of the iPad? The artist he questioned was going to do something and print it out and see what it sold for. He is going to fall down the yawning gap between the image on the screen and the flat printed version. Between additive and subtractive colour.

The irrational hatred of Apple and its products that has developed online is making a lot of people miss out on an important revolution in technology. Like it or not, Apple has been solely responsible for this change to date, so any article about the change is going to be an article about Apple. It wouldn't be accurate at all to make this article about "tablets" rather than iPads, since no other tablet has had a comparable impact. In fact, <i>not</i> making this an article about Apple would be poor journalism, since this is a story about what a <i>single company</i> has done. It's like suggesting articles about the Wright brothers should include all the people who saw what they did and announced they'd do the same thing in 18 months. (And, no, Apple wasn't the first company to make a computer shaped like a tablet but then the Wright brothers weren't the first people to attach wings to an engine.) Why should the article be inclusive of other companies announcements and plans, when Apple has had the only credible device on the market since April 2010?</p><p>In short, what I'm saying is this: There are going to be articles full of praise for Apple because what Apple has done is praiseworthy. They've spearheaded the next revolution in how we'll interact with our computers. A tremendous amount of what makes these new devices different from older computers was created by a single company. Much of it has since been copied. To act as if this isn't the case is completely disingenuous. People are going to be talking about Apple a lot. So get used to it. The fact that you personally dislike the company for whatever reason isn't going to change the fact that they've done something important, been tremendously successful with it and, as yet, nobody has managed to present a credible challenge. And even if 5 years form now Apple's market share is minuscule and some other company that you prefer is on top: Apple still would have been the main innovator and, sorry to say, articles will still talk about them favourably.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment" class="recommend" onclick="recommendComment(10206008);return false;">Recommend?</a> (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10206008">2</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10206008"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10206008" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10206008" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10219373"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/rquick" title="User profile page">rquick</a> <p class="date">3 April 2011 8:52AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p class="moderated">This comment was removed by a moderator because it didn't abide by our <a href='http://www.guardian.co.uk/community-standards'>community standards</a>.
