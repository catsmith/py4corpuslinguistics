<div id="article-body-blocks"><p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/microsoft" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Microsoft">Microsoft</a> has upped the ante in its bitter rivalry with Google by filing its first formal complaint to regulators, claiming the search engine giant is restricting competition.</p><p/><p>The US technology firm on Thursday filed the complaint to the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/european-commission" title="More from guardian.co.uk on European commission">European commission</a>, which announced a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/nov/30/google-search-eu-investigation?INTCMP=SRCH" title="formal investigation into Google in November">formal investigation into Google in November</a>, adding significant weight to the chorus of opposition which has seen complaints to Brussels from mainly small <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/internet" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Internet">internet</a> sites such as price comparison firm Foundem and Microsoft-owned firm Ciao.</p><p/><p>Microsoft acknowledged the irony of filing an antitrust complaint &#8211; the company has itself <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/jan/16/microsoft-microsoft?INTCMP=SRCH" title="paid billions in fines and levies">paid billions in fines and levies</a> in a string of protracted anti-competitive cases over the years.</p><p/><p>"Having spent more than a decade wearing the shoe on the other foot with the European commission, the filing of a formal antitrust complaint is not something we take lightly," said Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_on_the_issues/archive/2011/03/30/adding-our-voice-to-concerns-about-search-in-europe.aspx" title="in a blog posting">in a blog posting</a>.</p><p/><p>In a lengthy and detailed post Smith said that Microsoft had been prompted to act after witnessing a "broadening pattern of conduct aimed at stopping anyone else from creating a competitive alternative".</p><p/><p>Smith added that as "troubling" as the competitive landscape is in the US market "it is worse in Europe". with Google controlling up to 95% of the search market. The company goes on to outline a number of examples of a "pattern of actions" that it claims Google has taken to "entrench its dominance in the markets for online search and search advertising to the detriment of European consumers".</p><p/><p>Microsoft alleges that these anti-competitive practices include stopping its search engine, called Bing, from indexing content on Google-owned YouTube; blocking Microsoft Windows smartphones from "operating properly" with YouTube; blocking access to content owned by book publishers; and limiting the flow of ad campaign information back to advertisers, making it more expensive to run ads with rivals.</p><p/><p>"Over the past year, a growing number of advertisers, publishers, and consumers have expressed to us their concerns about the search market in Europe," said Smith. "They've urged us to share our knowledge of the search market with competition officials."</p><p/><p>Google said it would be "happy to explain" how its business works. "We're not surprised that Microsoft has done this, since one of their subsidiaries was one of the original complainants," said a spokesman. "For our part, we continue to discuss the case with the European commission."</p><p/><p>A spokeswoman for the European commission said: "The commission takes note of the complaint and, as is the procedure, will inform Google to allow it to submit its own views. No further comment."</p></div>

That said, Google is just the best search engine. Hands down. And as a company, they provide many services to the American people for free. Microsoft, who gives nothing to anybody, has a failing search engine. Never mind the tanking products outside of that realm. So to make up for lost revenue, they will focus on lawsuits to make the money they used to make. Or try anyways.</p><p>Here's the thing. Lots of folks don't really mind Google's approach. I, for one, like having them as the juggernaut force in web services. They provide many services for free, they perform very well, and have a pretty positive affect on the general public. Microsoft had the reins, and never took the time to think about what they could give the people. Thus, people don't really care for them as a company. Their products are buggy, but they work. They are expensive, but we need them for business purposes. And nobody has ever felt any sympathy for them. (It would be like feeling sorry for the old man who always yells at kids in the neighborhood, and shoots at stray animals on his lawn.) Sure they may have some points in this case, but I kinda doubt anything will come of it. Bing is just not very good when it's compared to Google. Simple as that.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10182764">17</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10182764"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10182764"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10182764" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10182977"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/hiphoppopotamus" title="User profile page">hiphoppopotamus</a> <p class="date">31 March 2011 2:30PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <blockquote><p>as a company, they provide many services to the American people for free</p></blockquote><p>Just the American people?

How is that not anticompetitive? (I know this doesn't just apply to MS). It was even found as such in court, they where to be broken in two (a OS business and a software business), but then they got out of it!</p><p>MS bully the OEMs to force Windows on us, and those of us free of them, end up paying to not have it! ("Windows Tax")</p><p>MS where given a monopoly by IBM from the get go and have maintained it with every trick in the book, and a few new ones they came up with themselves. Many of which come under "dirty trick". I could rant about MS and standards, but it's old ground everyone knows (the perverting of the ISO process, &#8220;working to rule&#8221; incompatible implementations of standards that fit the words but not the spirit, backing patent encumber standards (that they are large holders in the patent pool of) over free standards, etc etc).</p><p>Even the MS fan boys must be able to see Goolge are less bad by a order of magnitude or two, even through the MS cool aid vision. If Google do go properly evil, we can just change search engine, big deal. Many people aren't ready or able to change OS and that's before you taken into account they are locked in. (Yer, Android on your phone, but that is made of free code (Linux), we can just use a free fork like Replicant, or just a normal Linux, and all that will get much more love if Google/Android goes evil.)</p><p>Man, that's some stones MS have.

Perhaps that can be explained by this illustration; Copy the exact text of a Windows error message, and paste it (in quotes) into the search terms field on Bing. Do the same thing in Google search. Which one brings you relevant results *at the Microsoft Web sites?" Google does. Bing's search engine is so utter shite that it can't even properly index Microsoft's own KnowledgeBase sites.</p><p>Microsoft has finally figured out that they can't compete on product quality, and it's not possible to outright steal Google's code (like they did with i4i's XML), so they've fallen back on the SCO method of competition: Litigate until you destroy your own company. Except they've decided to let the EU's taxpayers shoulder the financial burden of frivolous litigation, rather that doing it themselves.

They've also been offering a free search engine for at least as long as Google. Sure, it's not as good, but you can't credibly say that Microsoft doesn't offer a portfolio of free services and applications when they've been doing it since before Google was born."</p><p>Generally speaking, when Microsoft gives something away for nothing it's in a move designed to kill off some upstart company with new ideas. </p><p>When the Internet first surfaced in the early 90s, Bill Gates apparently thought it was a fad that would last two years at most. When Netscape's share price rocketed, Microsoft went on the search for a browser with which to kill off the upstart Netscape.<br/>Microsoft approached a company called Spyglass (ever wondered why there's a magnifying glass on the early IE icons) and came to a deal to bundle Spyglass's browser with Windows for which Spyglass would cop a percentage. Once Spyglass became Internet Explorer and was bundled with Windows for free, Microsoft's attitude to their "partner" company became one of x% of zero is zero so you can piss off. Spyglass sued and Microsoft settled for $8 million, a minute fraction of the amount Microsoft made through effectively stealing Spyglass's product via a contractual loophole.</p><p>Once Java came along, Microsoft knew they had no competing product so they came to an agreement with Sun allowing them to embed Java in Windows. Their next move was to add proprietary Java extensions to Internet Explorer ensuring that content created to run with Java in IE would probably look like a car crash in competing browsers. In order to show Sun how it should be done, Microsoft came up with ActiveX which could do everything Java could and more. The "and more" was made possible by the fact that ActiveX would whore itself out to any bit of code that came along leading to the horrific string of digital diseases and malware that plagued Windows for 15 years. </p><p>As for web based email, Hotmail was originally set up by a startup company with Microsoft buying them in 1997 which, incidentally, was the same time that Yahoo mail and many other web based mail services came along.</p><p>If you go back through Microsoft's history, there's a stream of corporate corpses left behind by Microsoft's unethical, dishonest and monopolistic behaviour. There's also substantial evidence of Microsoft loading the International Standards Organisation with shills in order to push its Office XML format through the approval process. The documentation submitted to the ISO fails to meet the standard required to allow third parties to create applications capable of meeting the standard yet somehow, it got through.</p><p>And this is the problem with Microsoft. Huge corporations have an inertia that smaller companies do not and this is where the true creativity comes from unless of course, there's a company so huge and well funded that it can flatten everything in its path with impunity. Google may not be perfect but I fail to see anything matching, or coming any where close to the string of lawsuits that Microsoft have been of the receiving end of. </p><p>Where does this leave Microsoft? Back in the early days, they made all the right business decisions . They made sure that hardware and software developers had the tools they needed before the next version of WIndows was released and they knew that as most people's first contact with a computer would be at work, if they cornered the business market, people would buy the system they were familiar with for home use. They also focused on software, letting hardware companies do the rest . These were concepts that every other manufacturer failed to grasp and they died away as a result. As well as this, Microsoft ensured that it was first to market with new features like USB. The problem with this was that in order to meet release deadlines they'd rush it out as fast as possible and spend the next two years patching and service packing products to the condition they should have been on release day before forcing everyone to upgrade to the next under-tested mess of a release.</p><p>Microsoft are now playing catch up to everyone else's good ideas. Apart from the odd thing like Kinect, they lack imagination, creativity and originality and are now falling back on litigation and the tried and tested cash cow combination of Windows, Office and forced incompatibility with the competitors.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10186983">12</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10186983"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10186983"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10186983" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10187580"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/10/16/vadid/f5a0fd26-67d3-4185-aad0-fc607e241a54/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/vadid" title="User profile page">vadid</a> <p class="date">31 March 2011 6:49PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>I thought Bing just screen scraped their results from Google?</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10187580">2</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10187580"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10187580"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10187580" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10187700"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/smuk" title="User profile page">smuk</a> <p class="date">31 March 2011 6:58PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>Doesnt matter what Microsoft does.

At your next anti Microsoft recital you might want to look at what the U.S. DoJ had to say about Google's non-solicitation agreements with other Silicon Valley firms, the tax it dodges, the EU's antitrust investigations (link in 'Related information', below), that sorry business in China, and so on and so forth.

There may be a element of everyone roots against the old guys.</p><p>But that doesn't mean Microsoft and Google are the same. Capitalism breaks down when you have monopolies, but Google's monopoly is unlike others in that it is very fragile. As everyone keeps pointing out, we could all start using Yahoo, Bing or good old Altavista. Google know this and it keeps them hungry. Microsoft's monopoly is not fragile, people will continue with Windows because they have no choice, they might just drag their feet about upgrading until they &gt;have to&lt; upgrade to run what they &gt;have to&lt; run. Windows and Microsoft software is forced on people, Google search isn't. Everytime something has to be a closed MS format (Word/Excel), or can only be used with a MS product (IE), that is a abuse of a monoply. We are lucky that much of Office strangle hold has been eased by OpenOffice, but, like with anything that is trying to be MS compatible, MS are always trying to shake them off, to maintain the lock trapping customers.</p><p>I say, not only no company can make a closed operating system and closed software for that operating system, but formats must be documented with an open reference implementation.</p><p>Protection should be put in place to ensure competition, to promote capitalism. This is the wonderful thing about free software, no locks are event possible, everything is out in the open.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10188636">3</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10188636"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10188636"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10188636" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10188738"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2011/02/08/drhodesmumby/57ae094e-1d2f-4526-b6cb-8f7673fc9cea/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/drhodesmumby" title="User profile page">drhodesmumby</a> <p class="date">31 March 2011 8:24PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>It is fascinating to see this happen, a big step up in the conflict between the two titans of technology.

Same as Microsoft, News International and any number of other companies who stash the cash abroad. The problem isn't really Google, Microsoft or anyone else for that matter, they are all as bad as each. The real problem is that we live in a global system that not only encourages unethical behaviour nut actually rewards it. The EU anti trust action has had bugger all real effect on Microsoft's position and you can bet that even if Google is found guilty, they will escape in the same way.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10188870">3</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10188870"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10188870"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10188870" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10189298"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/gmseed" title="User profile page">gmseed</a> <p class="date">31 March 2011 9:09PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>That's rich coming from MS, who've done their best to wipe out as many competitors as possible since their inception.

And of course sticking with Windows maintains its position as the dominant platform, so the whole thing has reached the stage where the monopoly people complain about is sustained by the <i>users </i>rather than by Microsoft. Essentially if you buy a Windows PC and then moan that you had no choice in the matter, that's a) simply not true and b) making you part of the problem you're moaning about. It's the same reason people sign up to Facebook or Flickr, i.e. because everyone else does. They are natural monopolies.</p><p>The real 'dirty' monopoly and the reason they got into serious amounts of trouble was something far more insidious than Windows, i.e. their <i>software </i>and the way the company threatened to withdraw platform licensing unless it was sold with the PC. But in fairness that was some time ago. I have no doubt we will see the much younger Google end up in just as much trouble - like I said, it's all about money, and in which case you just have to give it time.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10194427">2</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10194427"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10194427"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10194427" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10194740"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/jabjoe" title="User profile page">jabjoe</a> <p class="date">1 April 2011 9:41AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <blockquote><p>thisisnotariot</p></blockquote><p>I've done some Googling on this looking it up.

Therefore, the lesson that Microsoft drew from that whole experience is that whingers can disrupt the cashflow of any successful, let's say dominant, company at will. All they have to do is take some half-baked complaint to the courts, and pay a lot of lawyers a lot of money to make their competitor's lives hell.</p><p>The penny has not dropped with Microsoft that it did anything wrong back then. That's why they think that they can get away with successfully suing a competitor that hasn't really done anything wrong either. Any old complaint will do, just as long as you stick "anti-trust" in there somewhere.</p><p>Does anybody really need any more evidence that Microsoft is finished?

MS claim it's about anti-piracy, avoiding customers buying Windows-less machines and then putting pirate copy of Windows on. You miss all the noise about France looking at putting a true Windows Tax on tablets? (Which couldn't run Windows anyway as they are ARM processors.)</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10195049">0</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10195049"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10195049"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10195049" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10195197"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/23/Killerbee/1353811c-a229-4274-9914-83f13a7c37c5/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/Killerbee" title="User profile page">Killerbee</a> <p class="date">1 April 2011 10:11AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>I find this a bit ironic, especially considering my recent experience upgrading to IE9 which seemed to take great delight in changing all my IE8 preferences and settings (including my default search provider) to the relevant Microsoft product without so much as a by your leave.</p><p>The upgrade was able to preserve things like my Favourites, and I find it very hard to believe it wasn't possible to keep Google as the default search engine.
