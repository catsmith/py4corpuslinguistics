<div id="article-body-blocks"><p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/nokia" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Nokia">Nokia</a> is suffering dramatic falls in market share worldwide, and RIM has seen a calamitous fall in its US sales - while the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/android" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Android">Android</a> mobile operating system is streaking past rivals in almost every developed country to become the dominant player everywhere.</p><p>New figures provided exclusively to The Guardian by Kantar WorldPanel Comtech shows Nokia's market share for <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/smartphones" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Smartphones">smartphones</a> dropping from 10% to just over 1% in the US over the past six months, meaning it sold only about 160,000 top-end devices there. The story is the same for the troubled Finnish phone manufacturer in every country over a 12-month or six-month period, with a collapse in market share that bodes badly ahead of its quarterly financial results due this Thursday.</p><p>The story is no more encouraging for RIM, which according to Kantar has seen a huge fall in the number of sales in the US, the world's biggest smartphone market. There its share has fallen from 32.5% in June 2010 to just 10.6% in March 2011, meaning that it only sold an estimated 1.4m devices there.</p><p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/apple" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Apple">Apple</a> is also being rapidly eclipsed by Android devices, though Kantar notes that the introduction in the US of its <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/iphone" title="More from guardian.co.uk on iPhone">iPhone</a> to the Verizon network provided an uplift to sales, so that it actually increased its market share there. But in other countries, notably the UK, Germany, France and Japan, the iPhone saw double-digit falls in market share - which could mean that even if it is selling more phones, it is not growing the number as quickly as the market is expanding.</p><p>Meanwhile <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/microsoft" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Microsoft">Microsoft</a>'s Windows Phone launch has made barely a ripple, with the company's share of the market falling in every country as the last of its previous-generation Windows Mobile phones are phased out. Kantar's figures suggest that only 1m Windows Phone devices were sold since they launched - around half the number that Microsoft has repeatedly said have been "shipped". </p><p>"The key underlying trend is that Android is growing in every country," said Dominic Sunnebo, consumer insight director for Kantar. "Windows Phone handsets have had virtually no impact on the market; until Nokia starts to produce versions of them, I don't think that we are going to see anything, because there's no key reason why you could choose one over an iPhone or Android phone - those can already do everything you might want to do with a Windows Phone handset."</p><p>Sunnebo warned that Apple faces serious dilution of its market share unless it expands its handset range quickly. "The lesson of Android is that if you release enough handsets, they are going to sell. It's hard for Apple to compete against that if they're only producing one new handset per year, especially when the growth in this market is among the low-end devices. Apple is profitable in the developed markets such as the US, but if you look into the future, at countries like Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, there's no way that they can get serious penetration there because of the import duties adding to the sheer cost of the phone. Places like that are where [Nokia's] Symbian is dominant, and that's where Android is getting to be dominant now."</p><p>Rumours have circulated for some time that Apple will try to expand its iPhone offering to take in low-end buyers, as it did when it expanded into the cheaper end of the digital music player market with its iPod mini in 2004. But at that time it controlled the music player market - a situation that doesn't apply with mobile phones.</p><p>RIM faces problems because the ASP (average selling price) of its handsets is falling as it tries to expand sales - which keeps revenues strong but cuts profits. "They've realised that they can't compete with Apple and they're struggling against Android," said Sunnebo. </p><p>Meanwhile Windows Phone faces a difficult transition period while it waits for Nokia to make its move, announced in February, to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/feb/11/nokia-microsoft-sign-strategic-tieup">bury Symbian on smartphones and replace it with Windows Phone</a>. The Guardian has forecast that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2011/feb/17/nokia-windows-phones-october">Nokia will not be selling any Windows Phone devices before October</a>, when Microsoft is expected to release a substantial upgrade to the OS, codenamed "Mango", with enhanced functionality that should put it on feature parity with iOS and Android's present capabilities.</p><p>Kantar produces its figures from a global consumer panel, carrying out around 1m interviews per year in Europe alone. It tracks mobile phone purchasing and other behaviour. The data provided excludes enterprise sales.</p><div class="embed block">

What that means is what we have all known anecdotally - Android users are cheap. Android is replacing Symbian - &gt;50% of the market, but &lt; 10% of app downloads. Except the android users may have free apps. No games, of any note, of course, John McCarmak has said that ID is not interested in free apps.</p><p>Apple have already won the Tablet war. Its different from phones for a few reasons</p><p>1) There is no carrier subsidy. Carriers are pushing Android phones because it nets them greater money on data plans ( they subsidised iPhones for that reason too).<br/>2) Apple is the cheapest on the block for proper Tablet machines ( i.e. with capacitive screens). They have also sown up the supply chain. The margins on iPads are much smaller than iPhones - the idea was to dominate the market from the beginning.<br/>3) They started at 100%. Unlike with phones. </p><p>The zoom aint selling.</p><p>not that Apple wont make a comeback. Get an iPhone out there which is as cheap as the iPod touch ( Â£189 post VAT here) and the low end modern smartphone is APple's if they can meet supply.</p><p>Not that it matters that much to APple - they probably want to win the tablet wars and dominate downloads.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment" class="recommend" onclick="recommendComment(10417356);return false;">Recommend?</a> (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10417356">14</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10417356"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10417356" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10417356" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10417385"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/yahew" title="User profile page">yahew</a> <p class="date">18 April 2011 6:09PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <blockquote><p>I'd be interested to see what companies are making the most profit in the smartphone market.

Any proof of this? I tend to avoid most rumours if I'm honest, and I never listen to rumours about potential release dates since Apple tend not to release any information whatsoever.<br/>If you look at history, Apple tend to follow an annual refresh cycle for the iPhone, so probably a more accurate guess would be a new phone in June/July.</p><p>I also don't believe the iPhone 4 is playing catchup. A major aspect of smartphones is the apps they have available to them, and iOS + the App Store are a huge player in the market. The iPhone 4 is an outstandingly designed piece of kit too, and there - even now - is not a better-looking phone out there.

From the leaked BOMs and estimates, an iphone costs less than a couple of hundred bucks to make. Apple make several hundred dollars on each handset sold, then a third of everything that passes through the app store. They're not interested in the low end, there isn't enough markup and more importantly it devalues their high end. Their business model REQUIRES them to not dominate the market if they want to remain premium. They innovate new markets then retreat to the high margin end and sit there counting their money while everyone else squabbles over the scraps.</p><p>As a slight aside, Google aren't trying to run an app store like Apple's or sell phones. Google aren't a search engine or a smartphone OS creator, they're an advert flogger. All their activites are centered about doing this - they collect search results, they collect your habits, they collect your details, they collect your history, ALL to target adverts more effectively. Android is Google realising how important mobile computing is going to be and ensuring they have a big chunk of advertising space reserved.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment" class="recommend" onclick="recommendComment(10417989);return false;">Recommend?</a> (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10417989">8</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10417989"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10417989" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10417989" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10418295"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/23/dirkbruere/4cb0a9ac-33db-43a3-aacd-082a497d09b9/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/dirkbruere" title="User profile page">dirkbruere</a> <p class="date">18 April 2011 7:26PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <blockquote><p>@Smashy79<br/>Why would Apple want to get a piece of the lower end of the market?</p></blockquote><p><br/>Next year's low end is this year's high end</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment" class="recommend" onclick="recommendComment(10418295);return false;">Recommend?</a> (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10418295">6</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10418295"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10418295" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10418295" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10419158"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/Oflife" title="User profile page">Oflife</a> <p class="date">18 April 2011 8:51PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>@12344321: Very true.

But: many of those are replacements - according to RIM's own numbers less than 40% of RIM phones are now going to new users (compared to 57% in late 2006, for example).

Apple's phones are made on their behalf by Foxconn - hmm? Apple are in practice a designer of electronic products and the producer of an operating system. Their involvement in the final product is of course significantly greater than Google's but the blank statement that they <i>make</i> the iPhone is a truth in need of serious modification. Google's relationship to HTC, for example, is not <i>entirely</i> unlike Apple's relationship to Foxconn (there are currently some 300 HTC engineers/designers "stationed" at Mountainview) although I suspect that the degree of input that HTC are permitted is somewhat greater than anything Apple permits Foxconn! HTC's degree of involvement is well reflected in both the reliability of the relationship between the os and the hardware (better IMO than with anything from Samsung, Lg or SE) and the fact that the "Sense" UI is the best "stock" Android UI on the market. The assertion that Apple makes its own phones whilst Google simply farms that job out to OEMs is a black and white statement in need of several shades of grey.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment" class="recommend" onclick="recommendComment(10421815);return false;">Recommend?</a> (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10421815">3</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10421815"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10421815" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10421815" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10421838"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> <img src="http://resource.guim.co.uk/discussion/static/1673/images/icons_staff_28.gif" width="28" height="28" alt="Staff" /> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/23/CharlesArthur/69b0c8ad-4a56-4770-a24f-17bf6639a6f4/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/CharlesArthur" title="User profile page">CharlesArthur</a> <p class="date">19 April 2011 6:16AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>@smashy79 "Other than the Google Nexus One (which I understand is actually a HTC phone), Google haven't made any smartphones (to my knowledge, although feel free to correct me)."</p><p>Google Nexus S - Samsung.

Having huge numbers of "browser window with some css optimised for viewing my website on an iPhone" apps ceases to be of interest when the novelty wears off - just like the PC market, where the millions of Windows applications boil down for most people to Office. I don't believe the "app" market is long term. The simple fact that "Angry Birds" is the default setting for mentioning anything that runs on phones should make the point.</p><p>Smashy79: Google make exactly the same number of phones as Apple, that is, zero. The difference is that Apple designers have more control over the finished product than do Google because they specify the form. But the manufacturing takes place elsewhere.</p><p>tathan: Just because the parts of a phone cost, say, under $100, that does not mean that the net cost to the supplier is anything like that. There is such a thing as amortisation of R&amp;D and production engineering. If you sell enough, at some point the price can be dropped closer to the raw manufacturing cost because the sunk costs have been paid off - but you still have the ongoing costs of marketing, channel, and support. A Â£30000 BMW probably costs around Â£12000 to make - but BMW's profits are not 60% of turnover.</p><p>Aliententacles- I also agree. Although the N900 is now very old tech (600MHz cpu) and the phone interface needs work - the rotation is crap - Maemo could have succeeded as a phone for technical staff (which is actually quite a large market.) Nokia have beaten the Labour Party to the "longest suicide note in history" in my view.</p><p>The only thing which might cause me to ditch my N900/thin and light laptop combination would be if HP's webOS delivers the promised tight integration later this year and I can switch to a Veer/Touchpad for mobile working. Android currently has the problem of a phone and a tablet with different operating system versions. iOS seems to suffer from the same problem to a slightly lesser extent, and Windows has it in spades. The idea that HP is promoting, that by 2013 all my electronic tools might run the same UI and also communicate seamlessly, seems far more useful than being able to download a restaurant guide for Outer Fencepost, WA.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment" class="recommend" onclick="recommendComment(10422455);return false;">Recommend?</a> (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10422455">4</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10422455"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10422455" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10422455" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10422524"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/meestersmeeth" title="User profile page">meestersmeeth</a> <p class="date">19 April 2011 8:53AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>Whenever an analyst says something like "Apple needs to release a lot more handsets or they're going to lose" it just tells me that the analyst hasn't got a clue about Apple's way of doing things and what matters to them.

The last iPhone had what appeared to be a design fault in the boring matter of actually making phone calls.</p><p>HTC's phones are nothing special in physical design, but they have come from nowhere in just a few years to have very significant market share, and the stock market values them higher than Nokia. They do not have an "app market". Stephen Fry doesn't care if they live or die.

PROFITS or MARKET-SHARE?</p></blockquote><p>Depends.<br/>Any CEO knows that you can raise profits quite easily, if you only need a year. Close R&amp;D, stop all marketing, get rid of expensive managers and engineers. Cut costs. A year later you will be profitable, CEO gets bonus, but the company is heading in a downward direction. (This used to be called "City short-termism")</p><p>Then if you have a lot of market share and you want to raise it, you can often do that by cutting prices and throwing money at the channel. In a year or so you will have market share, but you will be heading downwards just as surely as the "cashflow first" guys.</p><p>The above is true whether the turnover is billions or a few million.</p><p>If you are in it for the long term, <i>all</i> parts of the business and the finances need to be in balance. This simple fact explains Apple's problem and Nokia's dilemma. Apple has profits but longer term market share is under threat, and in IT terms it is an unbalanced company. Nokia had market share and was profitable, but the business was out of balance (too much overhead for the many cheap phones it made, and stuck with a fast-obsoleting software base).</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment" class="recommend" onclick="recommendComment(10424876);return false;">Recommend?</a> (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10424876">3</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10424876"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10424876" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10424876" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10425091"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/23/ThwartedEfforts/52f65731-ed26-46b6-98bd-37731e21cd1c/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/ThwartedEfforts" title="User profile page">ThwartedEfforts</a> <p class="date">19 April 2011 11:35AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <blockquote><p>Apple share falls less quickly as Google operating system takes over </p></blockquote><p>uh huh.

Is this expected market share 2011, market share until a certain date in 2011? Additionally, some of the numbers are plain wrong. Symbian was nowhere near a 10% market share in the U.S in 2010. More like 1% for Symbian, Nokia sold almost only cheap S40 (prepaid) phones in the U.S. in 2010.Then there is another misleading number: Japan shows Symbian sales, virtually none of them are Nokia, but local Japanese phone makes using Symbian O.S.What else is wrong in these numbers? I would not trust a single data point in the table above. Better go for IDC, Gartner, Dataquest etc for some more reliable numbers.But hey, the obscure organization Kantar does 1m interviews:"Kantar produces its figures from a global consumer panel, carrying out around 1m interviews per year in Europe alone."1m means what? 1 Meter? 1 Minute? One half of an m&amp;m??? Must be interesting interviews....</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Er...if you're not sure then don't slate the numbers. Kantar apparently are the 2nd biggest researcher globally. Have just spoken to an OEM (who is mentioned in the article) who say the numbers are on the money for consumer market (but does include not enterprise).

It's not about who has the best phone or the worst phone, who made the better decision choosing the phone that they *wanted* based on which handset has been bought by more people...</p><p>And anyway this particular dataset is just one way of looking at the mobile device world - compare the actual handset models sold rather than the operating system on the handsets and I doubt any single handset has outsold the iPhone by a significant margin - another reason why it might be preferable to only focus on one handset model a year and not 5 or in some cases even more. Alsternatively if you look at the spread of the OSs across all devices that can run them, iOS has way more share than Android. If that's important to you for some reason. (One benefit is that it gets more developers into the app store)</p><p>But none of this is a measurable factor of how much better your phone is than anyone else's. That's a *wholly* personal choice and it's kinda funny how many people use data like that described here as bragging rights somehow.

Smartphones can not only make a call but also access the internet via WIFI. Google and other Chinese manufacturer have reaslised that they do not want to tie to specific operating systems. So they have opted for Android (version of Linux) operating system which is free of course and there is very little development costs. People from CHina, India, Africa and South America will opt for the widely available this free operating system. Most of the schools are using Linus/Android to teach IT. </p><p>For a product to be popular it is not only the hardware but also the apps that are available for free or for a fraction of costs to use. There are now more Android apps than that are available for ipad/iphone. Apps development is growing everyday. </p><p>Watch out Nokia, RIM or any other newcomer in Smarphone market. Unless you adopt Android or Linux as your base operating system I do not think that you will ever catch up. Three billion people will soon use Android on there phones who ever makes it. Cheapest Andoid phone I found in China . It was selling for $5.00. </p><p>If companies want to make money by selling phones, adopt to freely available operting system. Talk to people in China, India and Brazil. The love free operating system and they develop application. </p><p>The market for smartphones is $100BL. If one wants share of this market, do not tie your system to your operating system.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment" class="recommend" onclick="recommendComment(10437593);return false;">Recommend?</a> (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10437593">0</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10437593"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10437593" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10437593" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10439497"> <li class="comment-author" id="end-of-comments"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/mark67" title="User profile page">mark67</a> <p class="date">20 April 2011 11:20AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>I think the next item of interest will be RIM v Windows 7.
