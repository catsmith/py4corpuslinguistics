<div id="article-body-blocks"><p>The majority of breaches of the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/data-protection" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Data protection">Data Protection</a> Act in the past year have been committed by private companies – but public sector bodies like local government have landed 80% of the punishments, according to new figures released under the Freedom of Information Act.</p><p>We've long wondered where the majority of data breaches – like lost laptops, email leaks, missing tax discs, etc – come from. Not least because the  <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/information-commissioner" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Information commissioner">information commissioner</a>'s office (ICO) <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/news/press_releases.aspx">seems to only make a noise about public sector transgressions</a>.</p><p>Figures obtained by encryption specialist <a href="http://www.viasatworld.com/">ViaSat</a> under the FoI Act show that since April 2010, roughly* 59% of all data breaches – those that have been reported and identified by the ICO as a breach – are related to private companies. However, 32 of the 40 penalties have been inflicted on public bodies. (*The exact proportion is difficult to ascertain as some sectors, such as health, are comprised of both public and private organisations).</p><span class="inline embed embed-media">

	</span><p><strong></strong>As the pie chart shows, private lenders account for the most breaches, closely followed by local government and then the health sector, largely comprised of the NHS. Within the private sector, financial organisations account for almost one in five breaches.</p><p>Of the 2,565 data breaches recorded since April 2010, when the ICO was given greater powers to penalise infringing organisations, only 36 have resulted in a punishment – and only four have resulted in financial penalties. </p><p>The smallest fine – £60,000 – was levied against the private employment services company A4e was in June after it <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/nov/24/hertfordshire-council-child-sex-abuse-data">lost a laptop holding unencrypted sensitive information about 24,000 people</a>.</p><p>Chris McIntosh, the chief executive of ViaSat UK, argues that if the ICO is going to be "more than an organisation handing out fines to local government" then it needs to be given more regulatory powers – something that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/privacy" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Privacy">privacy</a> groups have long argued should happen.</p><p>He said: "The ICO has stated that the private sector has a worse grasp of the Data Protection Act than the public. However, the ICO's actions so far do not seem to encourage any improvement. </p><blockquote class="quoted"><p>"For example, other organisations can easily look at the £60,000 penalty meted out to A4e, its size compared to the company's £145m turnover, its rarity and the fact that A4e is still receiving plenty of business, from the government no less, and feel that the risk of ICO action is one they are prepared to take."</p></blockquote><p>An ICO spokesman said its focus on getting bodies to comply with the Data Protection Act "isn't always best achieved by issuing organisations or businesses with monetary penalties." </p><p>The spokesman added: </p><blockquote class="quoted"><p>"The action we will take depends entirely on the details of each individual case. The existence of civil monetary penalties has had a markedly beneficial effect on compliance generally. The big stick is there, but doesn't need to be deployed all the time to have an effect.</p><p>"Good regulation is about getting the best result in the public interest. For a monetary penalty to be served the information commissioner has to satisfy a strict set of criteria including that the breach could have caused substantial damage or substantial distress to individuals and that the organisation knew, or ought to have known, that there was a risk that a breach may occur. </p><p>"We will always consider the imposition of a monetary penalty where these criteria are met."</p></div>

I've made numerous complaints to the ICO about UK companies spamming me. Every time, it's taken them about six months to finally come back and say "yes, they have spammed you illegally, but we're not going to do anything about it". </p><p>Amazingly, even when one company, Think Pink Cartridges, kept repeatedly spamming me, despite even getting a recorded delivery letter from me telling them to stop, and refused to even respond to ICOs enquiries, the ICO's response was "we won't be doing anything about it".</p><p>It seems to me that the ICO is rather like the Advertising Standards Authority - it's there to give the impression of regulation without actually doing anything to protect the public.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment" class="recommend" onclick="recommendComment(10441443);return false;">Recommend?</a> (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10441443">0</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10441443"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10441443" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10441443" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </div> </div>
