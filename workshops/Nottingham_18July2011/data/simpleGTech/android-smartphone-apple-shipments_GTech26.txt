<div id="article-body-blocks"><p>Mobile developers have a healthy disrespect for analyst smartphone forecasts. How many companies predicted five years ago that a Google-powered OS would have left rivals for dust in 2011, after all?</p><p></p><p>That said, this month's set of forecasts <a href="http://about.datamonitor.com/media/archives/5565" title="from Ovum">from Ovum</a> and <a href="http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS22762811" title="IDC">IDC</a> do have predictions worth chewing over for any developer trying to put together a long-term strategy.</p><p></p><p>They share the view that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/android" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Android">Android</a> will continue to lead the pack in the next few years, and by some margin. Two other points are just as interesting, though: the analysts' belief that there will be at least four smartphone platforms with a sizeable user base, and their confidence that Microsoft's <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/windows" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Windows">Windows</a> Phone will not be a flop.</p><p></p><p>Here are the topline stats. In 2016, Ovum thinks Android will take a 38% market share of smartphone shipments, followed by <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/apple" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Apple">Apple</a>'s iOS (17.5%), Windows Phone (17.2%) and RIM's <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blackberry" title="More from guardian.co.uk on BlackBerry">BlackBerry</a> OS (16.5%).</p><p></p><p>Other OS will account for the remaining 10.8%, with Ovum expecting at least one other smartphone OS to "achieve mainstream success" by 2016, citing bada, webOS and MeeGo as possibles, or a new entrant.</p><p></p><p>IDC actually thinks Microsoft will overhaul Apple a year earlier in 2015, when it sees the smartphone market being split thus: Android (45.4%), Windows Phone (20.9%), iOS (15.3%), BlackBerry (13.7%). It thinks Symbian will have shrunk to a 0.2% market share due to Nokia switching to Windows Phone, while others are pegged at having a 4.6% share in 2015.</p><p></p><p>Will all this come to pass? Stick your finger in the wind and guess: come 2015, Apple may have launched an entry-level iPhone. RIM might have pulled a Nokia and ditched its own OS in favour of, say, Android. And China in particular may throw up the wildcard fifth platform, with China Mobile, China Unicom and Baidu rumoured to be working on their own smartphone operating systems.</p><p></p><p>The analysts are bullish about the prospects of Android and Windows Phone, and they don't see iOS or BlackBerry falling away too much either. What about developers though â€“ do you agree that a few years down the line there will still be even four (or even five) major smartphone platforms demanding your attention?

It doesn't offer anything that would make you choose it over others. I can see BlackBerry falling further behind - they are bit of a mono-culture and their phones aren't terribly exciting. Pushing out horrible models like the 8520 certainly isn't leading the smartphone market. BlackBerry do seem to struggle to come up with anything that isn't a qwerty monoblock that people actually like.</p><p>Unless Apple really mess up, iOS probably won't slip back but growing might be hard: they have a high entry point in terms of cost. I must admit having concerns with Android - they look like a platform that might keep fragmenting and be pushed into cheaper and cheaper handsets that might might not really be up to the job. Symbian is effectively dead which is a terrible shame for such a mature OS. But I can't see where this confidence for WP7 comes from - Windows Mobile has been a stinker for years, from Windows CE onwards.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10165631">3</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10165631"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10165631" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10165631" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10165660"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/yahew" title="User profile page">yahew</a> <p class="date">30 March 2011 12:29PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>We know they know nothing, but they cant even extrapolate very well. Windows 7 is supposed to garner more sales than iOS, from &lt; 5%, because presumably they are on Nokia. But WP7 will either survive as a software platform or it wont, and I am guessing it is too late. If Nokia's hardware business was so successful a brand they would have had no need of moving to WP7, if WP7 was taking off they would have no need of Nokia. Synergy, hardware loyalty? Neither apply. Nokia phones running WP7 are all going to have to be touch screen devices, there is little to differentiate them from the rest of the field there, and they wont look like your dad's nokia so no muscle memory, or hardware preference can survive. </p><p>RIM is apparently going to stop bleeding market share, and grow as fast as iOS unit share, though it sells merely in the US in any numbers. iOS, which has gone from 0% to 15% in 4 years, and is not yet on all carriers across the world ( most obviously America), and merely beginning to take on China - where it grew 600% in the last Q - and is not yet available on entry level device they have admitted to be in the works, will grow at a compound annual rate ( of units) of 18% as opposed to the 100% unit last year. </p><p>Because is not open, init. </p><p>Neither is WP7. Anyway, devs should ignore this and concentrate on android and iOS. Everything else is pure speculative nonsense, and these guys have proven to be worthless over the last 4 years.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10165660">3</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10165660"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10165660" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10165660" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10166382"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/23/ThwartedEfforts/52f65731-ed26-46b6-98bd-37731e21cd1c/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/ThwartedEfforts" title="User profile page">ThwartedEfforts</a> <p class="date">30 March 2011 1:03PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>a lack of variety is one of Apple's strengths but it will also be its undoing.

They still don't offer a range of flavours to suit different palates, there is absolutely no variety, and while critics of such claim that one-size-fits-all thinking creates a safe haven for users, and that any nonuniform alternative is dangerous, why is everyone still using dangerous PCs and why is everyone now buying dangerous Android phones?</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10166382">15</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10166382"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10166382" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10166382" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10168138"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/yahew" title="User profile page">yahew</a> <p class="date">30 March 2011 2:29PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>@ThwartedEfforts</p><p>utter rubbish. If Apple have to add widgets to their devices to get the, um, "technically minded" people happy they can do that in the last 5 minutes of the development of iOS 5.0. Which will probably be a radical departure. If they want to differentiate their future lower end model they can make it look different. Nokia is one hardware manufacturer, with one OS. If Apple had not come along nobody would have been too surprised to see them continue to dominate. <br/> With the modern touch screen device there isn't much room for any differentiation anyway. you can have one button, or up to three.

Not an argument. </p><p>At the moment Apple is about 40% of the European market, where they are on multiple carriers. WP7 is nowhere.
