<div id="article-body-blocks"><p>We, my friends, are doomed. As you sit belching your way through holiday gluttony, updating your Facebook status while watching in horror as Grandma attempts another personal best on Kinect and little Jane shoves her new iPad in your face, society is crumbling around us. At the centre of our demise is the decline in the most sacred of social units, the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/family" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Family">family</a>. And you &#8211; yes you &#8211; are responsible.</p><p>Why? Because by communicating with your friends and loved ones via the world wide web you are actively colluding with the terrible culprit that's systematically upsetting the precarious social balance that separates us from the other primates. "The <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/internet" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Internet">Internet</a> Causes Death!" one unhinged headline reads. "The web is turning our children into code junkies!" says another. And there you sit, tweeting away, unaware that the pied piper is coming to shove your family off a cliff.</p><p>Oh, give over. The decline of the traditionally understood family has been on the cards since the sociopathic Cain knocked off his brother, Abel, for Daddy's fortune and that proto-emo Hamlet staged a passive-aggressive dig at his mum for poisoning his dad. Within the last 60 years, the piper role has been played by eternal teenager James Dean, a mop-topped Beatle, the oversexed Jimmy Page, the squat plumber Mario and the demon Marilyn Manson. Now that we've hit the 21st century, he looks like inauspicious Harvard drop-out Mark Zuckerberg. Tell me how this is a bad thing; frankly, I think we're on the up.</p><p>Researchers who've been studying the family from the days before the web had already described how family life was weakening because of the rise of individualism. Divorce was already on the increase before email, instant messaging and Facebook. Families were even then eating fewer meals together. It's an insidious trait of the adults of one modern era to point the finger at a technology they don't understand and blame it for the next generation's behaviour that they can't control.</p><p>"But but but," I hear you protest, "what <em>about </em>the children? They're learning bad things online!" Yes and they used to hang out on street corners and learn bad things there too. Now that we're so scared of one another in real-life that we won't pop next door for a cup of sugar in case the lollipop man has a gun or is a paedophile, the web is our way out of our gilded cages. And as escape crafts go, it's a pretty good one.</p><p>The web isn't killing family; if anything, it's saving it. We live in an increasingly transient world, where the need to make a living has given rise to mass migration to urban centres in every country. Children are separated from parents, siblings from one another and the web has provided us with the devices that make it easy to stay in touch. I live in the UK and communicate with my mum in India and my dad in Louisiana for virtually nothing. Mum follows my Twitter feed and my Flickr account and probably knows me better now than she has at any other point in my adult life.</p><p><a href="http://untanglingtheweb.tumblr.com/post/2384997910/interview-john-remote-dad-father-of-josh" title="">John is a reader of this column</a> whose job separates him from his kids, aged from five to nine, but he uses games and Skype to read to, play with and hang out with them for at least an hour a day before bedtime. "I read about someone's dad, many years ago, playing chess with his son using a Velcro board and the postal service," says John. "It's about inventiveness. My partner and I share a <a href="http://www.clubpenguin.com/" title="">Club Penguin</a> account; we do up our igloo as a place that is ours for the kids to visit whenever they like."</p><p>This is nothing novel; <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2008/Networked-Families/01-Summary-of-Findings.aspx" title="">a 2008 report from the Pew Internet &amp; American Life group</a> concluded: "Technology is enabling new forms of family connectedness that revolve around remote mobile phone interactions and communal internet experiences."</p><p>The closeness facilitated by the web that John describes doesn't replace face-to-face contact &#8211; you can't, for example, "have a hug", as his nine-year-old son Josh says &#8211; but it's better than nothing. In many ways, like the way in which it has created a global network, it's much better. There have been a few headline-grabbing reports of people finding long-lost family through social networks, which actually happened to another friend of mine. After years of thwarted attempts to find a sibling through traditional means, she and her sister followed the traces they'd left about themselves on Facebook. After making a few educated guesses and poking around a bit, they were reunited for the first time in their lives.</p><p>Everything I've been talking about is based on a very traditional account of the "family": siblings, kids, parents. But the 21st-century family is cut from a very different cloth than previous generations'. <a href="http://untanglingtheweb.tumblr.com/post/2397815708/interview-nick-henry-managing-director-of-national" title="">Nick Henry, managing director of the recently created celebration National Family Week</a>, describes the modern family as being "a lot more flexible than it has been: it covers those who are closest to you who support you through difficult times and decisions".</p><p>This broader family church, unrecognised by governments and most policy wonks, is undoubtedly supported in online interactions. <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2009/18--Social-Isolation-and-New-Technology/Executive-Summary.aspx" title="">Another Pew report</a>, of 2009, reviews all the literature that describes the depth and breadth of online connections that fall outside kinship groups and it describes how new technologies actually provide family-like social integration rather than encourage isolation.</p><p>Web technology itself hasn't undermined the foundations of the institution of the family. We've been doing that to families without it for centuries. What seems to be happening is that our online activity is actually reversing a worrying trend. So go on, post that video of Grandma on the Xbox to YouTube. She may not thank you for it now, but Uncle Bob, trapped in Basingstoke because of the snow, will appreciate it for ever.</p></div>

In fact Mrs Muscleguy and I have concerns that it is retarding the independent development of them. Whereas when we were young and away at uni or afterwards phoning home was expensive so we tended not to. Now our offspring contact us over the most trivial things they should have both the confidence and smarts to figure out for themselves. </p><p>In fact we have seen an increase in independence of the eldest since the move to the middle of highlands with intermittent net connections and dodgy mobile reception. </p><p>So like most human inventions there are benefits and downsides. I see a lack of confidence in knowledge now everyone has Google and Wikipedia. People have offloaded their memory and even understanding to the net, not bothering to remember or understand because they can always look stuff up. We always did that to an extent with books, but they are not as always on or immediate as the net, unless you live and work in a major library.</p><p>It is strange that access to more knowledge than we have ever had has this effect, very counter intuitive. It might be related to the phenomenon we have here in Scotland with people heading into the highlands unprepared and very poorly equipped but confident because they have their mobiles. The rescue services are getting a bit pissed off about it. There have been tragedies and near misses with people getting into trouble and finding they can't get a mobile signal in the middle of nowhere or down at the bottom of a steep sided glen.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-8937182">7</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/8937182"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-8937182"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/8937182" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-8937519"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/11/13/CptBennett/615e8af1-324b-437b-9949-1c8e444f5a10/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/CptBennett" title="User profile page">CptBennett</a> <p class="date">26 December 2010 10:48AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <blockquote><p>Now our offspring contact us over the most trivial things they should have both the confidence and smarts to figure out for themselves.</p></blockquote><p>I take it you mean your own offspring?

You think that you are having relationships with these people, but in fact you have relationships with Avatars. Your children think it perfectly normal to have such relationships, but then not to be able to deal properly at a social level. </p><p>This year a friend of England was speaking to me - our annual Xmas chat on the phone - he was amazed that in all the snow - there were no children out playing and yet there are plenty in his area. All sitting at home on their computers obviously. Facebook more comfortable than lobbying snowballs obviously.</p><p>Are people really surprised that since 1986 - men in the UK are on average 16 pounds fatter. I am not a computer-phobe but it is only a machine and you lot think that it is the answer to all your relationship problems. Think about the physical and mental problems you are all stoking up for the future - but go on I&#180;m sure your rellies and employers are going to be well chuffed. Not to mention your children who&#180;ll be thrilled to be living with regular steriods shots into their joints, back-braces, eyesight problems and as for those lovely armsplints. I&#180;d recommend electro-therapy though not that you lot would get that off your NHS. </p><p>Yes skype is just great as are similar - but the hours one spends on these machines is really silly and yes they are changing our relationships with each other. Many of the relationships people cite are those already formed in the real world. Those our children are forming are often not - if one can call them relationships at all. </p><p>And if you think that the "world&#180;s population...can be united by these technologies" - well it must really be nice living in your fantasy world. It seems such a nicer place than the real one the rest of us live in!</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-8952930">1</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/8952930"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-8952930"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/8952930" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-8969263"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/22/raincoaster/1d5872e8-294e-4d9a-8aa0-2be25f3c2a70/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/raincoaster" title="User profile page">raincoaster</a> <p class="date">30 December 2010 1:48PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>I live and teach family blogging (among other things) in Canada, and to us, the internet is a godsend.
