<div id="article-body-blocks"><p>The culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, appeared to have kicked the ball into the long grass when he <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/feb/01/ofcom-review-digital-economy-act">asked Ofcom</a> to review the workability of the government's controversial web blocking plans earlier this year.</p><p>In fact, measures that could put some 100 alleged illegal <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/file-sharing" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Filesharing">filesharing</a> websites behind a new <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/internet" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Internet">internet</a> firewall continue to move apace.</p><p>Proposals are being mooted on two fronts: one could establish a new version of the <a href="http://www.iwf.org.uk/">Internet Watch Foundation</a> (IWF) – the organisation which presently scours the net for illegal images of children, obscene adult content and "non-photographic child sexual abuse hosted in the UK" – to deal with illicit filesharing; the other would put Google and the government on a collision course.</p><p><strong>Proposal #1</strong></p><p>Rights holders and internet providers are understood to be roughly in favour of an industry-wide "<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/mar/22/isps-urged-to-block-filesharing-sites">voluntary code</a>". This code would govern how and which filesharing sites are censored. Rights holders would likely have to satisfy a number of points – for example, how much of the site is infringing? – before a Pirate Bay-like site would appear to vanish from British screens. It would still be there, just unreachable.</p><p>But that wouldn't be the end of the process. The code could establish a independent third body akin to the IWF that would implement the code and ultimately decide which filesharing sites are censored. No small feat.</p><p>Detractors argue that such a newly created body would simply be too expensive and time consuming – not to mention how you decide who sits on its board.</p><p>A second variant, favoured by the legal professionals, is for a judge to rule whether a site should be blocked <em>after</em> the voluntary code has been satisfied. This would quell ISPs' fears about having to paying compensation to sites that claim to have been wrongly blocked, and also negate the need for a new body.</p><p>The blocking techniques involve a variety of methods. The belief is that they will be powerful and effective. But they are potentially expensive, because as the idea is not to block entire sites, but just the parts of them where there is pirated material. That's rather like the IWF, which does the same (with <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2008/dec/09/iwf-wikipedia-unbanned">mixed results in the worst case</a>), and it's very labour-intensive. Get it wrong - by banning the wrong part of a site, or the wrong site, or not banning something - and there could be no end of trouble.</p><p><strong>Proposal #2</strong></p><p>How about Ofcom's web blocking review? The first key difference with the Ofcom review is that it has been asked to do its work against the backdrop of the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/digital-economy-act" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Digital Economy Act">Digital Economy Act</a> - in other words, this won't be voluntary, but set in a statutory context.</p><p>The media regulator is expected to advise Hunt at the end of the month on the following terms:</p><p>• Is it possible for access to a site to be blocked by internet service providers?</p><p>• How robust would such a block be – in other words would it have the intended effect, and how easy would it be to circumvent for most site operators?</p><p>• What measures might be adopted by internet service providers to prevent such circumvention?</p><p>• How granular can blocking be – i.e. can specific parts of a site be blocked, how precise can this be, and how effective?</p><p>• How effective are sections <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/17">17</a> and <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/section/18">18</a> of the Act in providing for an appropriate method of generating lists of sites to be blocked?</p><p>OK. So how would blocking work in the Ofcom model? According to people consulted by Ofcom in recent weeks, the regulator is thought to be "leaning down the domain name blocking route". </p><p>Although Ofcom is not expected to recommend one blocking method over another, it will spell out the pros and cons of each.</p><p>Domain name blocking – or DNS blocking – makes an <em>entire</em> site unavailable, not just parts of it, and is relatively inexpensive for ISPs to implement. Italy has used it to block the Pirate Bay, while parts of Scandinavia use it to censor child abuse sites.</p><p>However, British internet users will be able to subvert this block simply by going to Google. The search giant offers an "<a href="http://code.google.com/speed/public-dns/">alternative DNS provider</a>", meaning any internet user can ditch the setup offered by their ISP and use Google's own. </p><p>Would Google block sites like the Pirate Bay, BitTorrent or Newzbin2? We'll let that question hang.</p><p><strong>A lost cause?</strong></p><p>Whether any of this will work depends on your terms of definition. While acknowledging that the "most determined" infringers can circumvent web censors, rights holders insist that most people don't bother and it is simply to "enforce a code of behaviour". If something is on the internet, it must be legal. Right?</p><p>Others argue that blocking access to filesharing sites will simply make workarounds a common currency. Asked how easy these filters are to circumvent, one prominent web blocking expert told me: </p><blockquote class="quoted"><p>"You need a reading age of about 8. You should go talk to school children and ask whether the blocks their school puts up are effective."</p><p>"I don't expect ministers to be experts, but I expect them to talk to experts for a few minutes to see how it works before they open their mouth."</p></blockquote><p><br />It's a big debate, with lots at stake. Where do you stand? Do you use illicit sites, and would you still do so if they were blocked?</p></div>

Well done Mr Mandleson.<br/>Implementation of this act will see hundreds of families up and down the country put under stress as parents receive punishments for their children’s downloading behavior. I can’t understand why, in these times of cost cutting and financial crisis, the government is trying to get service providers to pay for an unpopular law sneaked through at the close of the last government, that they, the service providers themselves don’t want.<br/>If the media companies want internet policing then they should pay for it.<br/>If the money that record companies had spent on lobbying and chasing people through the courts had instead been spent building internet servers capable of distributing mp3s at 10p a track then they would have built themselves a future proof business model. Record companies seem obsessed with the ‘buy a bit of plastic’ business structure. The free music genie is out of the bottle, and no amount of stick waving is going to put it back. <br/>As usual the ministers making laws are so far behind the real world. <br/>What about VPN connections? What about Pay As You Go data 3G sims? Public wi-fi in internet cafes? Who is responsible for securing your home wi-fi? And who should be punished if you don’t?

Welcome to the black market.</b></p><p>We the people do not like governments who dictate what we can and can't see on the internet. In all reality these sorts of measures only serve to popularize the real alternatives. </p><p>Very soon we'll all know what a DNS is and how to get a new one from Google et al. A process that will be as easy as the casual user signing up to Facebook. Indeed already, people all over the world are already discovering that their official DNS is no longer a source that can be trusted. Very soon the ISP's DNS will no longer be the default option for ordinary users. Similarly years ago, people then too abandoned their BBS-web for an inter-web. Anyone here remember AOLv1.0 and MSNv1.0?</p><p>These government proposals are not only a complete waste of time and resource, they will be responsible for creating the next level in secret interweb sophistication, a black market which, if forced to flourish and develop in this way, promises to destroy the creative industries as we know them. Because, once the black market discovers how to be completely hidden while allowing casual users simple, convenient and secure (oh yes indeed) access, it will develop unhindered by government taxes and regulation. And who knows, the start-from-scratch secret internet may even conquer IPv6 where it's legitimate counterparts have failed!</p><p>But despite the claims of the industry doomsayers at the present time, only a relatively small number of people currently access content from unofficial sources on anything like a regular basis. As things stand the industry has it pretty good, albeit for all too many middlemen demanding too much from actual creators and consumers on either side.</p><p>Governments must learn to listen to the people and not only the industry controllers. But if they refuse, they will discover the hard truth that it is governments, at the end of the day, who lose legitimacy and not the people. The people will always win in the end. </p><p>Similarly the creative industries must look to the people, their customers, consumers, the fans, or whoever, for solutions and cease demanding that governments use brute force methods. And if they refuse, their economic empires will ultimately collapse, all in good old-time fashion.</p><p>Government and creative industry <i>must stop right now </i>before they lose everything. If they do stop and start to listen they'll find people much more willing to sign up for a more reasonable approach. People don't want to be blocked from content, and they are always willing to pay if the price is right.</p><p>Blocking websites makes an enemy of all the people. We don't need that war. But if that's what the government wants then the people will win. And the internet will win too, Tim Berners-Lee should have no fear of that.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment" class="recommend" onclick="recommendComment(10428764);return false;">Recommend?</a> (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10428764">0</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10428764"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10428764" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10428764" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10429057"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/ontheotherhand2010" title="User profile page">ontheotherhand2010</a> <p class="date">19 April 2011 2:51PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>@wherepimpsrunfree<br/></p><blockquote><p><br/>reports last week said the newzbin will be offering TOR browsing, making all of this effort useless.</p></blockquote><p>Very handy, this <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en" rel="nofollow">Tor Browser Bundle</a> that is mentioned there.

You say "peer-to-peer", and instantly people assume it's file-sharers handling the latest music/films/etc. But, P2P has legitimate uses, too.</p><p>Each time a new Ubuntu comes out I tend to d/l it via the torrents, as I find them faster. Then, as I like to Give Something Back (tm), I seed my download until the ratio is 200%. This is all done via P2P (BitTorrent), and because it's done in this way, it takes the load off of the download servers hosting Ubuntu.</p><p>Then, there are the times that ISPs choose to do "traffic management" within their networks. If they are doing this in it's simplest form, then they look at the tcp/udp ports in use, and restrict the bandwidth on them. Once when I was on Virgin Media, my PS2 online (as it was at the time) was b0rked for a week because VM had implemented a new traffic management policy to cut down on P2P. It did a marvellous job. Sadly, they hadn't realised that there were legitimate uses of P2P - including how some online games share data/VoIP amongst the gamers.</p><p>The trouble with this blocking, is that it will only be successful if:<br/>a) It does what it says on the tin (i.e. the sites are blocked), and more importantly<br/>b) it doesn't affect any other perfectly legitimate use of the 'net.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment" class="recommend" onclick="recommendComment(10431232);return false;">Recommend?</a> (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10431232">0</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10431232"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10431232" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10431232" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10431643"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/ShockJockey" title="User profile page">ShockJockey</a> <p class="date">19 April 2011 5:18PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p><i>didgesteve 19 April 2011 8:56AM Files sharing is with us for the foreseeable future and it’s not going away.

Just collect an amount on the sale of every DVD, CD, USB flash drive or hard drive, and then distribute the money to the content owners. If you download any material you are going to store it somewhere, so just charge the storage unit upfront. Makes sense, doesn't it? As a result, your download is legal and you have already paid upfront for it.</p><p>The content owners must register for getting a slice of the pie, and should in fact encourage their contents to be available and downloadable to be eligible for being paid back from the money so collected. </p><p>This process also eliminates the obnoxious lawyers who are basically out there to collect a neat pile without any sweat.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment" class="recommend" onclick="recommendComment(10433411);return false;">Recommend?</a> (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10433411">0</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10433411"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10433411" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10433411" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10434201"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/Puffings" title="User profile page">Puffings</a> <p class="date">19 April 2011 9:12PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>@axmukher<br/>A terrible idea.<br/>If I write a book about Jedward you *have* to pay me for it?<br/>James Cameron's next movie has the same income as an episode of Thomas The Tank Engine?<br/>No thanks.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> <a title="Recommend this comment" class="recommend" onclick="recommendComment(10434201);return false;">Recommend?</a> (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-10434201">1</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/10434201"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-10434201" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/10434201" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-10440241"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/23/kermitbantam/941e4877-d9d7-439f-b1af-bd8f7f0dd19d/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/kermitbantam" title="User profile page">kermitbantam</a> <p class="date">20 April 2011 12:03PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>@ axmukher:</p><p>They do that already.
