<div id="article-body-blocks"><p>In the first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series" title="Wikipedia: Foundation series">Foundation</a> novel, the science fiction writer <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2008/jun/09/isaacasimov" title="Guardian: Isaac Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a> imagined an expert whose particular skill was applying symbolic logic to human speech and documents in order to boil their statements down to the barest and clearest essentials. Five days' worth of discussions with a particularly clever politician were, by this method, boiled down to absolutely nothing: everything he said cancelled itself out. Without, it has to be said, anyone's noticing in real time.</p><p>Asimov was writing in 1951. Sixty years later we have a cruder, but simpler, automated method of achieving more or less the same thing, called the "<a href="http://www.wordle.net/" title="Wordle: Word clouds">word cloud</a>". Essentially, a bit of software goes through any type of electronic text and creates a statistical analysis of the words that appear in it. The software then creates a visual display using font sizes and colours to show at a glance which words appear most frequently. Geeks love this kind of thing, not least because word clouds sometimes show us obsessions we didn't know we had.</p><p><a href="http://www.davidmccandless.com/" title="David McCandless">David McCandless</a>, who specialises in visualising data, decided to apply this technique to the sun-sign horoscopes that appear on Yahoo! He and his team painstakingly scraped more than 22,000 horoscopes off the site, eliminated those targeted at specific groups (for example, teens) or types of questions (for example, career advice). The result, <a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/horoscoped/" title="Information is Beautiful: Horoscoped">Horoscoped</a>, is a set of word clouds for each of the 12 traditional star signs. The bottom line: note how, sign after sign, the same words dominate the landscape. Feel. Sure. Keep. Love.</p><p>Of course, sceptics have long maintained that your average mass-media sun-sign horoscope is a collection of meaningless banalities, an assessment with which many "serious" astrologers – that is, astrologers who do personal charts incorporating planetary movements – say they agree. Basically, mass-media sun-sign astrology is to pop psychology what Muzak is to easy listening. What McCandless shows here is that it isn't just prejudice to characterise these horoscopes as a triumph of the blandly reassuring.</p><p>Various experiments have shown this over the years. In one experiment, people were asked to pick their horoscope out of a basket of sun-sign predictions and failed. In another, the experimenters supplied birth data to several astrologers and sent the resulting horoscopes to subjects who supplied their own birth data – and who rated the accuracy of those horoscopes quite highly. In fact, of course, the birth information originally supplied to the astrologers was that of a notorious mass murderer. And so on.</p><p>My favourite was the experiment in which three groups of people were told variously that they were reading: 1) a personality description generally true of most people; 2) the horoscope for their sun sign; 3) a personal horoscope drawn up just for them by an astrologer based on their birth date, time and place. The bottom line: the more personal people believed the passage to be, the more highly they rated its accuracy. In all cases they were given the same passage to read.</p><p>But, of course, that only works as long as the horoscope contains nothing that might alienate the subject – which means that blandness and universal applicability are the keys to success. You win readers/subjects by giving them a sufficiently blank description that they can project themselves into it. And as long as you don't lose them by showing them anything they wouldn't like to think about themselves, you're golden. What McCandless has achieved is to winkle out the precise formula for becoming a successful astrologer. Feel. Love. Keep. Sure.</p></div>

Similarly, if I went to a different doctor I would generally get the same advice: antibiotics for infection, plaster and crutches for a broken leg.</p><p>But over the course of my life, doctors have probably said words like "infection", "penicillin", "x-ray", and "blood test" to me with about the same frequency that they've said them to most other people. An averaged out cloud would give similar results to the astrology example, except that it would show that doctors talk about illness and injury, astrologers talk about love and change.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9538929">2</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9538929"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9538929" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9538929" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9539168"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/23/meeh/057f135a-5f1f-450f-ac4c-400358efa7a0/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/meeh" title="User profile page">meeh</a> <p class="date">11 February 2011 4:30PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>apurimac - You seem to have missed the part where I agree with you out of your quote and repeated the bit I agree with again in reply. :D</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9539168">0</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9539168"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9539168" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9539168" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9539420"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/23/LondonEye/7c8fac6e-4027-4337-91aa-f0a8ad3d89af/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/LondonEye" title="User profile page">LondonEye</a> <p class="date">11 February 2011 4:42PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <blockquote><p>Of course, skeptics have long maintained that your average mass-media sun-sign horoscope is a collection of meaningless banalities, an assessment with which many "serious" astrologers – that is, astrologers who do personal charts incorporating planetary movements – say they agree.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>What McCandless has achieved is to winkle out the precise formula for becoming a successful astrologer. </p></blockquote><p>You mean a successful sun sign horoscope writer, not a successful astrologer. I'm sure you don't feel the need to make the distinction, since you already show your prejudice in describing serious astrologers as "serious" astrologers. But even this piece acknowledges a distinction (albeit backhandedly) and then comes to a conclusion which ignores that distinction. If this had bee a piece on something scientific, it would have to be retracted because of innaccuracy. But because astrology is officially rejected by the mainstream establishment, inaccuracies are allowed to pass. Seems pretty unjust to me.</p><p>Yet another prejudiced piece of writing on astrology. How about a comment piece from a serious astrologer? You know, one who has studied it at length and can speak about it from a position of authority.

So people do comment on these boards because there's disagreement. So why not have an experienced astrologer above-the-line so that people BTL can disagree. As for tearing it to shreds, well, only superficially. Astrology deals with the psyche, with psychology and emotions. Naturally there is an ambiguity because the psychology and emotions are ambiguous concepts. </p><p>It's very difficult for anyone to explain a different viewpoint when the person listening has already made their mind up. If the other person genuinely wants to try and understand, then fine. They don't have to disagree. But too often on here there are those who seem happy to fit into a stereotype view of the world, where sneering at astrology, homeopathy, paranormal phenomena is just a default position. Astrology is a useful tool for understanding one's own psychological and emotional processes.</p><blockquote><p>AlexJones: so you believe in God and astrology? Ever spotted the contradiction there?<br/></p></blockquote><p>When did I ever say I believed in God? Who's God? The God that you have in your mind? The God of some particular religion. You have not been paying attention and are quite willing to define me by your own terms rather than try and understand where I'm coming from. I haven't made up my mind about anything. But I am convinced that there is meaning that goes beyond the physical. And I believe that each of our individual consciousness (not the ego and identity, but the deeper sense of self) is part of a unified field of consciousness. I don't claim it to be fact. I don't want to push that belief on anyone. I just want to continue to enquire into the mystery of such phenomena as synchronicity and continue to read the work of pioneering psychologists and philosophers.</p><p>What I don't want to do is get caught in abusive tit for tat comments. I'm human and I make mistakes and I revise my position according to new knowledge. So does astrology, and like every other field there are skilled proponents and unskilled ones. To use the unskilled ones to attack the whole field is intellectually dishonest. And unfortunately, that's what I think this article is guilty of.</p><p>Anyway, that's enough from me.

You are never rude to the person, but you can be savagely rude about what the person thinks. That seems to me a crucial distinction: people must be protected from discrimination by virtue of their race, but you cannot ring-fence their ideas. The moment you say that any idea system is sacred, whether it’s a religious belief system or a secular ideology, the moment you declare a set of ideas to be immune from criticism, satire, derision, or contempt, freedom of thought becomes impossible. </p></blockquote> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9545075">9</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9545075"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9545075" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9545075" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9545084"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2011/03/19/Fiction/7b5a54fb-cc8f-4ed1-b7f2-c68ca4a8ccbf/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/Fiction" title="User profile page">Fiction</a> <p class="date">12 February 2011 1:14AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>@LondonEye<br/></p><blockquote><p>Why the need to sneer?

(BTW, gravity's been ruled out as being too weak).<br/>2 - Why would the date and time of birth be of particular relevance? <br/>3 - Planets that are millions of miles away should surely be able to demonstrate their forces just a matter of a few more inches into the womb shouldn't they?<br/>4 - Why the date and time of birth, why not conception?</p><p>These are just a few of the unanswered questions that were brought up to which no reasonable answers were forthcoming.</p><p>Insanityprawnboy summed up the situation in his earlier post, put forwards some convincing evidence.

Without needing to look at the astrology comments, I can be pretty sure the majority of astrologers say nothing about planets "having an effect" on humans. Most astrologers would agree that the planetary movements merely reflect what is going on with an individual's psychology and emotions, which naturally impinge on the natural world. But you're not concerned with that are you? You've made you're mind up, so anything that comes along which challenges your world view you will dismiss, unless it conforms to your worldview.

There was such a things as sacred geometry, by which the Egyptians built the pyramids and the ancient Greeks built the parthenon. It was only several thousand years before the scientific materialists came on the scene.</p><p>the problem with this thread, and with all these types of threads, it's that it's populated by ultra-orthodox cynics, who sneer at anyone offering alternatives and use it to shut out debate. It should be right to ask questions, even absurd ones, without having them sneered at. But the cynic needs to do that to preserve their world view. Until that world view comes crashing down suddenly and the cynic is left wondering how it all happened.</p><p>So once again, I've made my point here and I can leave. Because a debate with such people, who use logic when it suits them and discard it when it does not, who sneer at other people's beliefs and expect other explanations of reality to first conform to their own parameters of debate (an impossibility), a debate with such people is impossible, certainly without being equally insulting and offensive. And that doesn't help anyone. </p><p>I'm wondering that, rather than try and make a case for why people choose to believe in astrology or any other paranormal phenomenon, it would be better to concentrate on staying among those who have an open mind, where there is enough disagreement, but at least a spirit of open-hearted discussion. It's as well to leave the cynics to backslap each other and wonder why the world doesn't care for scientists, journalists and politicians anymore, why trust in them has been eroded and why young people are turning to alternative explanations despite all these cynics jumping up and down in disgust.

Well done.</p><blockquote><p>Most astrologers would agree that the planetary movements merely reflect what is going on with an individual's psychology and emotions, which naturally impinge on the natural world. </p></blockquote><p>Ok, let's play it this way round for a minute then. How could a planetary movement reflect what's going on with an individual's psychology? Do planets change their orbits and positions according to what people think? Of course not, this scenario is even more daft than the original proposition.</p><p>If there's <i>no causality between the planets and people</i>, all that's left is some rather dubious correlation backed up by extremely vague assertions and interpretations. </p><p>In other words, they're making it up, as one astrologer, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9299335" rel="nofollow"><i>Genoa5</i> clearly stated</a> on the first astrology thread.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>3 - Planets that are millions of miles away should surely be able to demonstrate their forces just a matter of a few more inches into the womb shouldn't they?</p></blockquote><p>Quantum entaglement</p><p>Non-locality</p></blockquote><p>Jeez, where to start with this?</p><p>Firstly, you're missing the point being made, which is an extrapolation of my question regarding the relevance of the date and time of birth. Why couldn't these planetary "forces" affect the fully formed foetus before birth, all for the sake of a small amount of skin, fat and other tissues? For example, the <i>minimum</i> distance between Earth and Neptune is <i>4,300,000,000 kilometres</i>, surely just a few more inches shouldn't be a problem.</p><p>Secondly, you've argued against yourself, by implying that there <i>can indeed</i> be a causality from a planet, not just planets reflecting human psychology as you stated earlier.</p><p>Thirdly, bringing up quantum entanglement and non-locality merely adds to the list of things that you really don't understand and that you try to shoehorn into your spiritual worldview. </p><p>But hey, prove me wrong, show me how <i>quantum astrology</i> works. If you would like to explain further how quantum entanglement, non-locality, planets and human psychology are all intertwined then I'm more than willing to listen. Or are you saving this stuff up for the Nobel Prize Committee?</p><blockquote><p>Because scientists never do such things do they...</p></blockquote><p>They do tend to get caught out by the peer review process though.

So you would expect that the greatest astrological effect would be due to sun, vastly greater than that of any other object. Now, the problem with this is that the sun, being the centre of things, remains in the same spot relative to the earth.

Quantum field theories can account very well for non local effects, and no serious person would suggest that they do not adhere to 'traditional scientific methodology'. Your attempt to detach astrology from its burden of proof is misguided and dishonest, not to mention entirely too convenient.</p></blockquote><p>Just who's being disingenuous here? Quantum field theories might be able to account for non local effects, but are you really saying the idea that non-local effects are observable according to quantum theory can be explained by a mechanistic scientific model? How do you explain the discrepancy. Science can harness and use electricity, but science cannot really say what electricity is. There is a distinction.</p><blockquote><p><a href="http://www.fdavidpeat.com/bibliography/essays/healtech.htm" rel="nofollow">Subtle Connection: Non-Locality, Bell's Theorem, Coherent States and the Form of the Wave Function</a><br/>The non-locality inherent in a pair of initially correlated particles that become separated by a macroscopic distance has been investigated by Bell1 and in a variety of experiments.2 <b>These experiments demonstrate a non-local correlation that cannot be explained with reference to any "local" theory in classical physics.</b></p></blockquote><p>You know there is a discrepancy between Newtonian physics and quantum physics. Of course scientists spend alot of time grappling with such concepts. As I'm sure is made very clear here, though I have an interest in quantum physics from the point of view of eastern mysticism and philsophy, a la Fritjof Capra, I am not well versed in the intricacies of science so have to rely on scientists to be honest. But I get the feeling, often, that some so-called scientists rely on obfuscation because they realise that there is this huge discrepancy between Newtonian physics and quantum physics, and although quantum physicists can use and manipulate the theory and derive great benefit from it, they cannot even begin to fathom what the implications might be, unless the Newtonian idea of the universe as discrete mechanical parts is rejected in favour of the idea of a grand unified field where all the information the universe contains is instantly available at any other point of the universe. Such a mechanism would require a new paradigm. That is what many quantum physicists of the Capra, Zukav and Goswami kind are insisting will happen.</p><p>Now I'm not trying to force anyone to believe without some kind of evidence. But I am saying that to demand proof within a paradigm that I maintain is not equipped to perceive the fundamentals of why synchronicity is more than "confirmation bias", why "confirmation bias" is itself the wrong way of looking at the universe, why mind, universal mind, has still not been understood according to western science and why eastern methodologies, involving meditation, are better ways of understanding such philosophies as astrology, should be accepted as existing and of benefit to many without the need to attack it in such vicious and brutal ways. </p><p>As for disappearing (as I will do again). As I have said, I question whether I should waste my time arguing with those who, though they maintain have open minds, in reality are stuck rigidly within their scientific paradigm, within a philosophical outlook that still treats Newtonian physics as if it was real (despite the paradox of such quantum effects as non-locality) and who will shoot down anything that challenges that paradigm, as astrology obviously does. I have not the slightest sense that anyone here is truly curious as to how astrology <i>might</i> work. I get only the sense that everyone here <i>knows</i> it does not work, and is just waiting for me to explain so that they can use the usual Newtonian tools to shoot it down from within the paradigm that I and many astrologers, parapsychologists and many quantum theorists criticise.</p><p>So, with all due respect (and for the benefit of TheSmokingMan) and with regret that no true dialogue seems possible, I bid you all good day.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9555603">1</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9555603"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9555603" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9555603" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9556019"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/09/07/epeeist/1dd5d8ce-1cdf-4614-bc37-dff427350efa/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/epeeist" title="User profile page">epeeist</a> <p class="date">13 February 2011 10:45AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>@LondonEye</p><blockquote><p>Just who's being disingenuous here?

There is a distinction.</p></blockquote><p> We have a huge number of experiments to verify the mathematical relations between charge, potential difference and current though. The trouble with astrology is that the astrologers seem awfully reluctant to even clearly state their methodology, let alone submit it to repeatable scientific experiments. If they aren't even willing to do that then I'll give the practice no more credit than it deserves.</p><blockquote><p>I am not well versed in the intricacies of science so have to rely on scientists to be honest.</p></blockquote><p> Question people and ask them to outline their argument with evidence. That applies to everyone regardless of their qualifications.</p><blockquote><p>But I get the feeling, often, that some so-called scientists rely on obfuscation because they realise that there is this huge discrepancy between Newtonian physics and quantum physics...</p></blockquote><p> A lot of people will try to blind others with science and hope to get away with it - if they can't explain their argument and answer your questions honestly then they probably aren't doing their job properly and are just scared of being caught out.</p><p>From what I can gather quantum physics and Newtonian physics aren't entirely compatible with each other but we can still use each concept in certain situations and gain some interesting results and figures from them. Again, I've yet to see astrologers present their methods.</p><blockquote><p>...why "confirmation bias" is itself the wrong way of looking at the universe, why mind, universal mind, has still not been understood according to western science and why eastern methodologies, involving meditation, are better ways of understanding such philosophies as astrology, should be accepted as existing and of benefit to many without the need to attack it in such vicious and brutal ways.</p></blockquote><p> Firstly, there is no such thing as 'Western science' - water boils at 100 degrees centigrade the world over, being in a different culture does not change that. Science is about observing what you see and trying to draw conclusions from it. If a situation can be repeated and you can gain the same results, you might very well be onto something.</p><p>Astrology should be treated as a philosophy, not a science. When people start demanding that we give it undue credit and reverence like certain posters on the astrology threads a while ago, then we'll get annoyed. Asking for evidence to support their claims is not 'viciously attacking' astrology (but I know some of the astrologers really played up on the victim mentality when questioned).</p><blockquote><p>...within a philosophical outlook that still treats Newtonian physics as if it was real (despite the paradox of such quantum effects as non-locality) and who will shoot down anything that challenges that paradigm, as astrology obviously does.</p></blockquote><p> Newtonian physics can be very useful in large-scale situations - we use ideas in quantum physics when we're dealing with things on a microscopic scale. So it's useful in that we can do things like predict solar eclipses and launch rockets and so on.</p><p>Yet again, astrology has not proven itself to do anything near as useful or even produced a consistent set of results and methods. We don't doubt astrology because it's something new (and please don't flatter yourself to think that we're scared, it's laughably absurd), we doubt it because no convincing case studies have been presented in its favour.</p><blockquote><p>So, with all due respect (and for the benefit of TheSmokingMan) and with regret that no true dialogue seems possible, I bid you all good day.</p></blockquote><p> Ah, the defence of the astrologer - 'I can't explain my ideas thoroughly, so I'm going to give up and say that they will always be above you.'

Quantum field theories might be able to account for non local effects, but are you really saying the idea that non-local effects are observable according to quantum theory can be explained by a mechanistic scientific model?</p></blockquote><p>I'm not quite sure what you're getting at. What do you mean by 'mechanistic scientific model'? In QM, you set up experimental parameters and observe the results. There is nothing at odds with what would normally be construed as a robust scientific model. I vaguely recall a recent experiment (a Bell test) carried out on the Canary islands, in which two photons were entangled and sent to different detectors (called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_bob" rel="nofollow">Alice and Bob</a>) on different islands. A change in the properties of one photon resulted in an instantaneous change in the properties of the other. The results apparently provided further proof that nature violates local realism and thus the view that reality exists with definite properties even when not being observed. This is at odds with classical physics in the sense that special relativity (itself a 'classical theory') would state that the objects could not influence each other, because no physical signal could travel faster than the speed of light. But the objects <i>are</i> influencing each other, and doing so instantaneously! Anyway, my point is that QM is still business as usual for science and the scientific method. </p><blockquote><p>unless the Newtonian idea of the universe as discrete mechanical parts is rejected in favour of the idea of a grand unified field </p></blockquote><p>What age are you living in, seriously? Newtonian physics was shown to have its shortcomings when general relativity came along, <b>almost 100 years ago</b>. Anytime you want to catch up with the rest of us, feel free. </p><blockquote><p>Science can harness and use electricity, but science cannot really say what electricity is</p></blockquote><p>Of course it can. It's a physical phenomena associated with stationary or moving electrons and protons.

Ever heard of Feynman's sum over histories? Ever heard of Deutsch's many world's interpretation? Stop asserting things of which you clearly have no understanding of. And please, <b>please</b>, stop bastardizing science to suit your own preconceived bullshit notions of the the world.

Once you have beliefs about the person still being there in some form, then you get beliefs that you should provide for them and start burying grave goods. These are then the target for theives, so you need to find a way to protect the grave - you build a roof over it. Because the grave is rectangular and the coffin is rectangular then it make sense that your roof is too. Then because of the advance of civilisation and the stratification of society some poeple have more access to wealth than others and show off by having bigger rooves than anyone else. One person has a roof so big it becomes a pyramid. Don't get too hung up on pyramids though as the pyramid age was a fairly short-lived experiment at the beginning of the civilisation that didn't last very long. It ended up bankrupting the monarchy and causing a period of social breakdown. oh and BTW the builders were anything but slaves. Pyramids would have been built during the annual flood so farmers who would otherwise have been sat around doing nothing were paid to go and work on the pyramid.</p><p>Egyptian mathematics is intensly practical in nature. (hence why threads such as this that talk about their sacred geometry always make me laugh). I don't think symmetry is really part of it, although proportion and order were. Figures in Egyptian art for example were drawn along strict rules for proportion of the different parts of the body that hardly change over thousands of years.</p><p>If you are interested in funerary architecture have a look at Death in Ancient Egypt by A J Spencer, The Pyramids of Egypt by IES Edwards and Ancient Egyptians by Rosalie David.</p><p>To get back to astrology - the Egyptians didn't use our signs of the zodiac, that was a Graeco-Roman import.

You sound like a child. I do not have to respect your beliefs.</p></blockquote><p>And I do not have to respect you pathetic beliefs. There. East is East and West is West and never the twain shall meet. And you wonder why wars happen. You smell your own coffee. My beliefs work for me. You continue with your abuse, telling me I sound like a child, whatever allows you to feel comfortable in the notion that no one who is intelligent and educated could ever use astrology to understand their psychology. You do that, because there are millions who do not think like you. You can continue to brand them, but you will be no closer to understanding them. It has everything to do with a political ideology and that political ideology will one day fall and the world will wonder how it could have survived under such a limited world view for so long. But that's how humanity evolves. Slowly. And right now you can sneer and insult safe in the knowledge that the official narrative will back you up and see your slander as reasonable. </p><blockquote><p><b>BlankVellum:</b> That's a very simplistic characterization. Too simplistic. Furthermore, there is not just one model, as you imply. There are many, and they each work in different contexts. You're misrepresenting science yet again, and I struggle to believe it is entirely by accident. Remember what I said above, about you bastardizing science to suit your own preconceived worldview?</p></blockquote><p>Simplistic it may be, but no less accurate and you know it, which makes you the one guilty of misrepresentation. You haven't even tried to understand the point I am making. You are quite capable of getting the point I am making, even if you do not agree with the conclusions I draw from it. I too struggle to believe you do this by accident. Since there is no trust or goodwill here from you, since you are close to accusing me of being a liar and deliberately misrepresenting, and since you have not made any attempt to comprehend the point that a mechanistic universe cannot account for effect at a distance, then as on the last thread, what is the point of carrying on a debate. </p><blockquote><p>Why just humans? What about other organisms? Are you suggesting that people are given some sort of special status over and above the rest of the animal kingdom? And if so, why are you being so spectacularly arrogant?</p></blockquote><p>What about other organisms. In a grand unified field theory, with the concept of consciousness underpinning the universe, animals are accorded far more status and intelligence than in the present scientific paradigm, that uses animals to experiment, tortures and kills them for sport and curiosity and sees humans as pre-eminent. </p><p>But to approach the subject from a different angle, as long as we see things from our point of view, as long as we ask questions, then whether eastern or western astrology, whether tarot, i ching or cartomancy, any system of divination attempts to use the principle of synchronicity and correspondence between the inner subjective psychology and the outer world to gain information about an individual's present state and thus help plot a course of action that will render the best possible outcome for the future. </p><p>But, as I said, and once again, I expect, as always, for the answers from the usual suspects to be parsimonious and cynical, with a smattering of insults and derogatory comments about my attempt to be genuine and speak my truth. I use astrology, my own chart, and I have gained a greater understanding of my psychological make up over the years. I find it useful, as I find meditation, yoga, tai chi and other spiritual pursuits useful. If others wish to deride me and feel superior because of it, that is their choice. </p><p>So, really, once and for all I will stop here on this thread and possibly once and for all, since I know what is coming, the usual boorish, cynical behaviour from the usual motley crew. Sad but inevitable.

I said that your characterization of science and the scientific method was too simplistic. What I meant was precisely the opposite of your assertion, in that it is <b>not</b> accurate. You are simply pigeonholing science into this strange parochial 'mechanistic' characterization to fit your own warped worldview. </p><blockquote><p>You haven't even tried to understand the point I am making.</p></blockquote><p>if you had a point to begin with, its been long since lost to your pseudo-scientific drivel.</p><blockquote><p>since you have not made any attempt to comprehend the point that a mechanistic universe cannot account for effect at a distance</p></blockquote><p> </p><p>Are you that blinkered that you can't see how obvious a strawman this is? This is precisely the point I was trying to make, but which <b>you</b> failed to understand. Nobody is stipulating absolutes in science, because it simply doesn't work that way. You keep suggesting (I'll say ignorantly for now, simply because I can't tell if you're being deliberately dishonest or not)) that scientists think that the universe is entirely mechanical and that the result of QM are wrong. <b>Nobody is suggesting this</b>. </p><blockquote><p>In a grand unified field theory, with the concept of consciousness underpinning the universe</p></blockquote><p>Why in Ra's name would we suppose that a GUT (of which there are <b>many</b> potential candidates) would use consciousness to underpin the entire universe? Your arrogance really doesn't know any limit does it.</p><blockquote><p>and sees humans as pre-eminent. </p></blockquote><p>I guess not.</p><blockquote><p>But to approach the subject from a different angle, as long as we see things from our point of view, as long as we ask questions, then whether eastern or western astrology, whether tarot, i ching or cartomancy, any system of divination attempts to use the principle of synchronicity and correspondence between the inner subjective psychology and the outer world to gain information about an individual's present state and thus help plot a course of action that will render the best possible outcome for the future. </p></blockquote><p>You keep using this idea of 'synchronicity' as if it was an argument in favour of your position. It is exactly the opposite. It is a fallacy no matter which way you want to look at it.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9560481">2</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9560481"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main" /> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9560481" /> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks" /> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9560481" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9560673"> <li class="comment-author" > <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile" > <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt="" /> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/shalomachzav" title="User profile page">shalomachzav</a> <p class="date">13 February 2011 6:59PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>@AlexJones</p><blockquote><p>so you believe in God and astrology?
