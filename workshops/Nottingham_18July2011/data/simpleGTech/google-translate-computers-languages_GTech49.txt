<div id="article-body-blocks"><p>Were you to run perhaps the most famous line in literature, the opening sentence of <em>Anna Karenina</em>, through Google Translate from Russian to English, this is what you would get: "All happy families resemble one another, each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."</p><p>The translation, which approximates to the best "human" version of the sentence, looks like a triumph for what used to be called artificial intelligence and now is called, less ambitiously, machine learning. The computer can understand language, we are invited to think. Run the subsequent lines of <em>Anna Karenina</em> through the system, though, and the picture, along with the grammar, is not quite so clear.</p><p>"All mixed up in a house Oblonskys. Wife found out that my husband was in connection with the former in their house, a French governess, and told my husband that he could not live with him in the same house. The situation is now lasted three days and were painfully conscious of themselves and their spouses&#8230;"</p><p>It's just about explicable, if we know the original, but barely readable. The reason for this discrepancy lies in one of the nuances of Google's system that allows interested users to improve translated texts where they can. Somebody has obviously got to the first line of Tolstoy's masterpiece and put it right. What follows is more representative of what the system is capable of.</p><p>Ever since computers were a reality, the possibility of using their logistical power to break down barriers of language has been something of a holy grail in machine learning. The initial &#8211; unsuccessful &#8211; attempts were based on the principle that all languages could be distilled into two components: a lexicon of words with specific meanings, and a set of rules of grammar and syntax by which those words were linked together. The cold war prompted ambitious efforts by American intelligence agencies to understand the "code" of the Russian language on an industrial scale. It produced mostly gibberish.</p><p>The first significant breakthrough in the potential of mechanised translation came in the early 1990s when IBM produced a model that abandoned any effort to have the computer "understand" what was being fed into it and instead approached the task by installing in the computer the comparative versions of as much translated text as possible and having the system compute the probability of meanings of words and phrases based on statistical precedent. The approach was pioneered by Frederick Jelinek at IBM, who, distrusting models that grew from analogies with human learning of grammar, insisted: "Whenever I fire a linguist, the performance of our system improves."</p><p>A decade or so later, though, the statistical-based system was becoming severely limited, particularly so when it attempted translations from languages in which there was comparatively little text to "learn" as reference. It was at this point that Google entered the field in earnest. The impetus for Google's translation machine can be traced, corporate legend has it, to a particular meeting at the company's California headquarters in 2004. One of the search engine's founders, Sergey Brin, had received a fan letter from a user in South Korea. He understood that the message was in praise of the innovative scope of his company, but when Brin ran it through the machine translation service that Google had then licensed it read: &#160;"The sliced raw fish shoes it wishes. Google green onion thing!"</p><p>Brin believed that Google ought to have the capacity and determination to improve on that particular piece of nonsense. In the years since, as its global interests have grown, the free Google Translate service has evolved to attempt instantaneous translations from 52 languages; it offers a "toolkit" for speakers of more marginal languages to establish their own services, and it is used tens of millions of times a day to translate web pages and other text.</p><p>The great improvements Google has pioneered in that time have been based almost entirely on its unique access to vast quantities of translated text, billions of sentences, trillions of words, that can be searched for likely matches in seconds. A good deal of these data come from transcripts of United Nations meetings, which are routinely translated by humans into six languages, and those of the European Parliament, which are translated into 23.</p><p>Google has incorporated text from its comprehensive book-scanning project and other internet sources to add still further to that syntactical database. (In this it has the edge over its chief translation rivals, Microsoft's Bing and Yahoo's Babel Fish, which are based on broadly the same principles.) As a company, it is in the habit of making great claims for the possibilities of this effort. It announced earlier this year, for example, that the translation tool was being combined with an image analysis application that would allow a person to take a mobile phone picture of a menu in Chinese and get an instant English translation. In the summer, it suggested that it would use speech recognition technology to generate captions for English-language YouTube videos, which could then be immediately dubbed into 50 other languages.</p><p>"This technology can make the language barrier go away," Franz Och, who leads Google's machine translation team argued. "It will allow anyone to communicate with anyone else."</p><p>That utopian promise is a seductive one. In his recent book, <em>The Last Lingua Franca</em>, Nicholas Ostler, chairman of the <a href="http://www.ogmios.org/" title="">Foundation for Endangered Languages</a>, argues that translation engines such as Google's will eventually liberate the world from the necessity of learning dominant languages, such as English, and will reinforce linguistic diversity. When I speak to Ostler he is convinced that these changes are inevitable: "The future is easy to predict, though you don't know when it will happen."</p><p>Despite a degree of fluency in 26 languages, Ostler says he is often on the Google Translate site and believes it represents this future. "Even if you don't like what it says, you can immediately make sense of what it gives you or compare it with what you know. It still needs constructive intelligence from the user. But the fact is that it is much better than it used to be and no doubt it will continue to improve."</p><p>One consequence of its wider acceptance, presumably, will be to make people more lazy about acquiring languages?</p><p>"There is," Ostler says, "a sort of irony in that; though we may see a more multilingual future, as English starts to wane, you will see less multilingualism in individuals." The fastest-growing languages online, he points out in his book, are Arabic, Mandarin Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish and French, in that order. "The main story of growth in the internet," he suggests, "is of linguistic diversity, not concentration."</p><p>Given the garbled state of much current machine translation, though, won't a shared language be as far away as ever?</p><p>Ostler argues that "mass production always gives you lower-quality stuff than artisan craftsmanship ever did. It is the same sort of consideration with Google Translate. Even so, there is no doubt that the more data that come in, the more languages that are assimilated, the better it is going to be."</p><p>Those who are working at the sharper end of the translation models tend to be slightly more cautionary about that future. Phil Blunsom, who lectures in machine learning and linguistics at Oxford, and has been involved in creating next-generation translation tools, suggests: "Most of the difficulties we face are what we call 'tractability'. Even in the simplest word combinations, we are searching through a massive space of possible options. For a computer to understand how a sentence works, it basically has to iterate over all possible options of a syntactic structure between different words and then work out which is the most likely. It is an exponential computational problem, particularly as sentences get longer and more complex."</p><p>Andreas Zollmann, who has been researching in the field for many years and working at Google Translate for the last year, suggests, along with Blunsom, that the idea that more and more data can be introduced to make the system better and better is probably a false premise. "Each doubling of the amount of translated data input led to about a 0.5% improvement in the quality of the output," he suggests, but the doublings are not infinite. "We are now at this limit where there isn't that much more data in the world that we can use," he admits. "So now it is much more important again to add on different approaches and rules-based models."</p><p>That is where the old problems start. Does Zollmann see a way in which those models can eventually learn languages as well as human beings can?</p><p>"No researcher would expect it ever to become perfect," he says. "Pronouns, say, are very difficult in some languages where the masculine and feminine don't correspond to each other. If you ever solve machine translation perfectly, then you have something that is properly artificially intelligent. Language is not separate from who we are."</p><p>There are those that believe, as a result, that far from liberating us from our linguistic barriers, the translation tools will in fact serve to reinforce them. Douglas Hofstadter, author of the seminal book on consciousness and machine intelligence, <em>G&#246;del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</em>, as well as several books on the theory and practice of translation, has been among the most trenchant critics of the hype around Google Translate. He argues that the ability to exist within language and move between languages, to understand tone and cultural resonance, and jokes and wordplay and idiom are the things that makes us most human, and most individual (one of his books was based on asking 80 people to translate the same poem and delighting in the 80 discrete versions that were produced).</p><p>The statistical models, he says, start from the wrong place. "There is no attempt at creating understanding and therefore Google Translate is doomed to the same kind of failure for ever. Of course they get occasional good results,  but essentially it is mindless. They are rendering a very low-level service that will always produce something not far above the level of nonsense. I suppose that we will all bow to the pressures to use it at some level, but it will never get the flavour of phrases."</p><p>Hofstadter suggests that just as, perversely, we seem to like the idea of the world getting smaller, so we like to think that understanding language is somehow mechanical, another problem we can outsource to our screens. "Understanding the world is what humans are good at and what machines are no good at, at all," he says. We may well all be Google Translators soon, but we may also find that, more than ever, we are lost in translation.</p></div>

Google and similar free MT (Machine Translation) systems, while helpful for the very basic user, for example to get the gist of a foreign language website or short phrases, are OK in principle, but their effect on the job market for professional human translators is detrimental, or at best a mixed blessing.<br/>Many companies or individuals, who would previously have ordered a human translation, now try to translate the text themselves using these MTs, before sending the result (usually a dog's breakfast) off to be "revised" or "proofed" by someone more proficient in the language (ideally by a native speaker). This leads to pressure on rates and an influx into the profession of unqualified, although cheap and cheerful, would-be translators offering cut prices. Professional translators have to jump through several hoops to cope with the effects of this intrusion, for example by charging special real-time rates for the time spent proofing (revising a badly translated text can take as long, if not longer, than a translation per se, although the per word rate for revision may be only 10- 20% of the translation rate).<br/>Translations are currently available from agencies in China, India and other places at rock bottom prices, albeit with varying degrees of quality.<br/>Most professional translators use TMs (Translation Memories) rather than MT, or a combination of both. These programs simply memorise terms and phrases and will scan documents for repetitions of them, inserting them automatically throughout the document and so saving keyboard bashing time. The system is particularly suitable for repetitive technical/industrial texts, or even legal, where set standard terms are repeated ad nauseam.<br/>However, I think most translators would agree that MT programs still leave much to be desired, and the most currently available programs are quite similar, and expensive, unlike market-busters Google, Babel.... etc etc.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-8868084">6</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/8868084"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-8868084"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/8868084" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-8868432"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/MichaelBulley" title="User profile page">MichaelBulley</a> <p class="date">19 December 2010 11:06AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <blockquote><p>The initial &#8211; unsuccessful &#8211; attempts were based on the principle that all languages could be distilled into two components: a lexicon of words with specific meanings, and a set of rules of grammar and syntax by which those words were linked together.</p></blockquote><p> Let us agree, then, that this was not only found to be an unsuccessful approach for machine learning of human languages, but is also an an unsuccessful way of looking at human language in general.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-8868432">1</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/8868432"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-8868432"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/8868432" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-8868509"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/23/serac/6bce0b72-8532-4597-8656-14af885fa281/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/serac" title="User profile page">serac</a> <p class="date">19 December 2010 11:15AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>Translating is not only about "understanding" language.

Learning languages is learning about peoples different than those in the UK, it widens the horizons.<br/>I would like to see the UK inviting (non language) graduates from every European country to spend some time in Britain and in turn sending (non language) graduates/ young people to all these countries for a year or two &#8211; it&#8217;s not just for business but simply for human-understanding.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-8870382">0</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/8870382"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-8870382"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/8870382" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-8871628"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/porius" title="User profile page">porius</a> <p class="date">19 December 2010 5:37PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>Periodically, people tell me that, as a translator, I will soon be superseded by a machine and be relegated to Jurassic Park. And they say this in a tone of sepulchral glee, quite as though my proximate downgrading were a matter for rejoicing and I would only get my just deserts. Another old fart to be chucked in the rubbish hopper for daring to challenge the computer. L&#232;se-majest&#233;, indeed!<br/>My response is to smile sweetly, as one may catch oneself doing with the infirm of mind (them). No point in contradicting the cherished illusions of these zombies who have exchanged the luddism of machine-breaking for the contempt of language and thought.<br/>I shudder to think how the text I have just rendered into English would emerge from a computer's maw &#8212; no style, no concert-pitch attention to the shifts of the author's emphasis, no selection among the vast choice of adjectives and verbs, no fine adjustment of syntax &#8212; and, eventually, no grammar if we ever achieve Newspeak. But it won't happen any time soon. The dreadfully sad thing is that anyone should want it to. By the same token, a medical friend of mine rubbed his hands and relished the prospect of curing (his word) mental illnesses entirely with drugs. Oh yeah? We know all about that, don't we!<br/>Courage! Continue to learn other people's languages, to be finicking about style in order to say exactly what you mean (assuming you mean anything), to delight in reading the novels of, say, Henry James and John Cowper Powys &#8212; to name only two of the great organ-voices of English language fiction. Mentally you may snap your fingers at the mumbling nerds whose vocabulary is confined to a few hundred words. But be nice to them, take trouble with them, persevere in showing them the error of their parochialism. Language and its use offer a vast cornucopia of enjoyment. And it doesn't cost much. Certainly far less than tinkering with investments in fraudulent banks on the advice of scoundrels who couldn't even run a news-stand or a chapati stall.<br/>Let us have two lessons per week in all schools &#8212; devoted to rhetoric, in the old and good sense of that term.

The main reason is, that it is difficult to learn, because of the declensions. And a lot of people would be disavantaged by the use of Latin. Esperanto is the fairest and most efficient one, even for Japanese or Chinese people. As I can speak 5 languages and have some knowledge of 2 others, I am able to compare... :-) I mean I really can understand these languages, read them and communicate (fr, en, it, sp, eo, + a little bit of german an polish)</p><p>Now, about Google translation. I use it sometimes, but I agree, that it is far from perfection... But nevetheless, it is usefull. Once I used it to translate a text from Dutch to French. The result was rather strange, but using my knowledge of English and German, I managed with it. In my opinion, these tools are good tools, but it should not be a "reason" to resign language learning.

Translation is not only a question of words but also of knowledge and perception of reality. What surprises me is that the author of the article speaks of translation as learning and use, namely a passive act. However, a language is not a package of tools to use and abuse; it is a lively and constantly changing convention, built and re-built by people living in touch (physically or on the internet for example). A machine can never do that! A machine may be useful for a rough translation but beware, it may also lead to sterile language. <br/>How did English come to life? How has English been evolving? <br/>When translating, we are participating in that adventure by not only using, but by decisively creating and re-creating languages.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-8874743">1</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/8874743"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-8874743"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/8874743" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-8875241"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/dodgyinjun" title="User profile page">dodgyinjun</a> <p class="date">20 December 2010 1:42AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>As someone who works in the translation industry and who has researched MT a fair bit (because obviously it's a potential threat to us) I keep on hearing the same stories from translators who say that MT is never going to be good enough to replace a human. </p><p>But I don't think that, at the moment, anyone is saying that and if you are using Google Translate to translate your legal agreement from Japanese to Swahili then you're a bit of a fool, to be honest. </p><p>What Google Translate does allow you to do, however, is read up on topics/blogs/tweets/Facebook posts/whatever that are not in your language, gain an understanding of what the writer is saying and, if interested, take the translation to the next level if you are interested. </p><p>The way we are positioning MT is a low cost alternative to regular translation. The user can get a gist for free and, if they want, get it post edited into a decent translation. We don't accept all Google Translation jobs - we consult with our translators and ask them if they feel they are able to complete the work more easily than if they were able to translate from scratch, hence the drop in rates. </p><p>What you have to remember is that there are billions and billions of words generated every day which some people somewhere may want to read. Google Translate allows them to make the decision as to whether they want to read it in their own language perfectly or not. </p><p>What the article didn't go into too much is statistical machine translation (SMT) which does learn through continuous feedback. Again, it isn't perfect no matter how many times you train the translation memory/engine but it does get better. In tests that we have done, our users (who work for companies) are able to save about 30% on their translation costs and time - they are more productive. This isn't taking work away from translators because these people were doing the translation themselves. But it was making their time more productive and they know (because we have shown them through testing) that the translation will continue to improve. </p><p>Basically, put this in context - who is going to use this and why? And will it make them more productive in whatever it is they are doing (be it work related or researching a hobby) and if so, isn't this a good thing?</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-8875241">0</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/8875241"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-8875241"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/8875241" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-8875648"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/johnwcowan" title="User profile page">johnwcowan</a> <p class="date">20 December 2010 5:03AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>Latin <i>is</i> too difficult to use as-is, but it could be and has been simplified.

But I don't think that, at the moment, anyone is saying that"</i> - oh but they are. I have heard this so many times and, as a professional translator, few things get up my nose more than this ridiculous assumption, which more often than not comes from people who have absolutely no idea about what translation actually entails. Machine translation on its own will never replace a human being. It just never will. A machine cannot understand cultural or historical differences, or explain a term that doesn't have an equivalent in the other language. It can't understand jokes or come up with alternative marketing slogans, no matter how many texts you feed in to it. Even in technical subjects, sometimes there is not a direct equivalent in the target language and a translator must undertake a great deal of research in a variety of sources (Internet, dictionaries, discussions with people who work in the sector) in order to come up with and corroborate an appropriate term. A computer may be able to guess a term but how would you know it was correct? Would you like to look up the effects of a foreign drug for, say, heart failure on Google Translate? I doubt it. Most of the 'translations' that come from Google Translate and Babelfish are laughable. If you want to find out how to order a beer before you go on holiday, or if you want to get the gist of a webpage, OK. But this is all it will ever be able to do. A friend of mine often uses Google Translate to look up the most basic sentences so he can ask me how I am, for example, in my source language and there is always at least one mistake and those are the most basic phrases. CAT tools such as Trados are great for building up glossaries and helping to translate technical texts where terms are often repeated, but even then, every sentence must be checked by a human against the original. There are some aids, such as Linguee (a free online German English 'dictionary' that finds translated texts and puts them side by side so you can see how a term has been translated by others) and they are a brilliant aid, but they are just that, aids. I would never rely on such a program alone and you must have excellent understanding of both languages to enable you to spot the mistakes and identify credible sources of a proposed term. So as far as 'getting the gist of website' when the exact meaning is not needed, MT would suffice but when it comes to professional texts, human translators will always be needed.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-8883650">1</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/8883650"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-8883650"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/8883650" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-8893331"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/traintastic" title="User profile page">traintastic</a> <p class="date">21 December 2010 11:55AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>I work for a <a href="http://www.translatemedia.co.uk" rel="nofollow">translation agency</a>.

There are stories of students submitting as their own work translations done with Google (they're easy to spot), and another misuse of Google is to use it to look up individual words ... much better to use an online dictionary. However, Google translate can be useful to get a first draft if you're in a hurry, and I believe correcting MT output (we call it post-editing) will become as useful and sought-after a skill as translating from scratch, albeit requiring different knowledge and training.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-8909059">0</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/8909059"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-8909059"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/8909059" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-8912934"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/YalexanderW" title="User profile page">YalexanderW</a> <p class="date">22 December 2010 6:44PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>You just know youre not going to trust an article very far hat tells you right off what the "most famous line in literature" is! It's real failure of knowledge of MT is the claim:<br/>The first significant breakthrough in the potential of mechanised translation came in the early 1990s when IBM produced a model that abandoned any effort to have the computer "understand" what was being fed into it and instead approached the task by installing in the computer the comparative versions of as much translated text as possible and having the system compute the probability of meanings of words and phrases based on statistical precedent. </p><p>This is nonsense------the main "hand-coded" MT system Systran (now available as Bebelfish) has been used in various forms at the EU translation HQ since 1977 or so: translation memos as rough drafts between English, French and German--and saving millions of man hours a year. All that long predates 1990's statistical MT--it is still not clear that statistical MT can beat Systran over a language both are good at. <br/>The whole Esperanto discussion is an irrelevance:MT has produced usable get-the-gist draft MT for 30 years and is increasingly used as a starting draft by translation agencies. As to translating hard stuff: for the last page of an MT book I did recently, I placed a Rilke poem translated by Google Translate--it wasnt bad, I have to admit--it sure sounded like poetry and not too far off the original (he's the right poet for this test, of course).</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-8912934">0</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/8912934"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-8912934"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/8912934" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-8922332"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/23/brianbarker/331696b7-4a24-4bf4-a512-daabaddd494f/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/brianbarker" title="User profile page">brianbarker</a> <p class="date">23 December 2010 3:30PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>Hitler was not the only person to ban Esperanto.</p><p>The first Director General of the BBC Lord Reith also banned the use of the word Esperanto in a memo to all employees [Durrant, E.

Like the Luddites, who tried, in support of cottage industries, to destroy machines in the Industrial Revolution, language teachers spread contempt for Esperanto in order to maintain their iron grip on the teaching of national languages. Unfortunately for the general public, those particular teachers, by teaching only extremely complicated languages, prevent most of us from communicating on equal terms with our counterparts in foreign countries, except, of course, the English-speaking ones. Most of us either do not attempt to learn a second national language, or fail laughably when we do so. If language teachers would only relent, and teach Esperanto to the generality of students, there would be a great improvement in internatiional understanding, for it is relatively simple, but perfectly adequate for any purpose. The most successful students could be taught national languages in addition to Esperanto. That would please everyone. So, language-teachers who read this, I respectfully urge you to change your attitude, for the sake of the rest of humanity.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-8923030">3</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/8923030"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-8923030"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/8923030" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-8923858"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/23/brianbarker/331696b7-4a24-4bf4-a512-daabaddd494f/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/brianbarker" title="User profile page">brianbarker</a> <p class="date">23 December 2010 5:43PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>Hello samideano</p><p>Is this some sort of spoof to destroy the argument for Esperanto as an international language? </p><p>I agree though that we should oppose the language imperialism of English as you imply.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-8923858">0</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/8923858"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-8923858"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/8923858" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-8926910"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/23/neilnachum/96369988-db3d-431d-a978-8dc406e2129b/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/neilnachum" title="User profile page">neilnachum</a> <p class="date">24 December 2010 1:35AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>Dear WTFCUK,</p><p>I share your concern about the participation of Chinese, Japanese, Koreans and Viet-namese in world-culture. Let me assure you that these ethnicities/countries all have among the strongest of Esperanto movements in the world. Google <b>Esperanto and China</b>. or <b>www.espero.cn</b></p><p>Seven percent of the United States are now Asians. Articles have appeared in the New York Times discussing the fact that nearly zero percent of Asian <br/>Americans participate in popular music. As a singer I confirm this from personal experience. I don't assume there are only linguistic/language learning explanations to this phenomena, but the mentioned articles leave no explanations at all. </p><p>I assure you that a good 10 percent of what has been printed in Esperanto during its first century was printed in China. A religious movement, Oomoto, in Japan strongly advocated for Esperanto. One of its wealthy members just paid for a two page ad in Le Monde, to celebrate the founder of Esperanto's birthday, regretably a day late, on December 16th, 2010. He has done this before. </p><p>There has long been a China Town in New York City and it took about a hundred years for a Chinese person/woman to be elected to represent the district in a recent election. There must also be a cultural aspect --not only a linguistic aspect---but let us consider all the possibilites. </p><p> Many Asian-Amercians are, of cause successful, in many other fields, notably in commerce and science..</p><p>The Asian experience is one of the greatest motivators of Esperanto speakers. While thousands of Asians are conversant in both Esperanto and English, they frequently confirm that the phonetic alphabet of Esperanto, it's lack of complicated idiomatic expressions and it's regular accent are among the aspects that make Esperanto many times easier for them to learn than English.</p><p>Stop the neo-colonial thought patterns dominant among too many worldly progressive people (and so many right-wingers who seek the status quo) and join a the potential and reality of Esperanto. Another world is possible and language will be a factor, though not the only one. </p><p>If any Asians or Asians Esperanto speakers happen to read this please intervene. We should not be speaking in your name.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-8926910">1</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/8926910"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-8926910"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/8926910" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-8927000"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/23/neilnachum/96369988-db3d-431d-a978-8dc406e2129b/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/neilnachum" title="User profile page">neilnachum</a> <p class="date">24 December 2010 2:05AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>Here is a short list of Asian Esperanto websites.

In fact if you look at any machine learning text book you'll rarely if ever find translation mentioned. This has been a goal of AI for a long time but ML is only one of a number of techniques that have and are been used on the problem. The learning in ML implies that the translation will not be perfect but may improve with more experiences. However, since people use language in such nuanced ways and with such depths of background knowledge and common sense machine translation will always struggle.</p><p>Consider the sentence: <i>"The elephant stood on the table it broke." </i> Which broke, the elephant or the table?</p><p>Nothing in the syntax of the sentence tells us which broke. Only our knowledge that elephants are big and heavy and tables might not support the weight gives us the probable meaning of the sentence.</p><p>Translation will never be 100% accurate because language isn't 100% accurate all of the time.</p><p>[btw: I'm a Professor of Artificial Intelligence so I actually know what I'm talking about]</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-8942067">0</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/8942067"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-8942067"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/8942067" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-8994205"> <li class="comment-author" id="end-of-comments"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/08/23/brianbarker/331696b7-4a24-4bf4-a512-daabaddd494f/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/brianbarker" title="User profile page">brianbarker</a> <p class="date">3 January 2011 12:09AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>I googled the word "Esperanzo" and got nothing.</p><p>However I googled the dead end language Esperanto and got 40 million hits.</p><p>As far as computer translation is concerned, how many people have computers in Africa ?
