<div id="article-body-blocks"><p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/nokia" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Nokia">Nokia</a> is not adopting <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/microsoft" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Microsoft">Microsoft</a>'s current Windows Phone 7 platform &#8211; which means that there is no chance of any handsets running Microsoft's software before the end of October. It is likely to be a lot later.</p><p/><p>Rather than using the current version of the Windows Phone platform, first released last October, the mobile phone company is going to wait until a major release of the operating system, codenamed "Mango", is made available this coming October &#8211; and that is expected to have a slightly different name from the current Windows Phone 7 name.</p><p/><p>Stephen Elop, the former Microsoft executive who since September has been chief executive of Nokia, and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2011/feb/11/nokia-microsoft-tieup-liveblog" title="announced dramatically last week">announced dramatically last week</a> that Nokia will abandon its market-leading in-house Symbian smartphone platform, has been careful throughout the week to refer to the adoption as Windows Phone &#8211; and not Windows Phone 7.</p><p/><p>That, coupled with his repeated refusal to offer any timescale for the introduction of handsets running Windows Phone this year, points to a decision to delay the introduction until the newer version of the platform is available.</p><p/><p>A Nokia spokesperson said that Nokia has committed to using Windows Phone but would not comment further.</p><p/><p>Though the difference between Windows Phone 7 and Windows Phone may sound trivial, Elop, who previously ran the hugely profitable Office division of Microsoft, will have been keenly aware of the importance of the difference in naming and the need not to be seen at any future date to have misled investors, analysts or customers.</p><p/><p>Mary Jo Foley, a ZDNet writer who follows Microsoft closely, <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/tipsters-windows-phone-7-mango-release-to-add-html-5-support/8214" title="previously revealed">previously revealed</a> that Mango will be renamed, possibly to Windows Phone 7.5, with Windows Phone 8 following at the end of 2012. But Mango, which adds a number of new features including HTML5 support, is not due until autumn at the earliest.</p><p/><p>However it would have been impossible for Elop to announce last week that Nokia is adopting Windows Phone 7.5 as it would have given away too much about Microsoft's then-unannounced plans, and the delays implicit in Nokia's plans.</p><p/><p>Yet his refusal to say that Nokia is adopting Windows Phone 7 &#8211; a phrase that he has never used in a single one of the dozens of interviews and speeches he has made in the past week &#8211; now stands out.</p><p/><p>Elop has been briefed on upcoming Microsoft branding efforts. For example, at the announcement last week Elop did not mention Microsoft's Zune music platform as one of the benefits of the tieup; he said Microsoft has a "great software platform" in Windows Phone, and the brands that mobile consumers want, "such as Bing, Xbox Live, and Office."</p><p>Yet neither Elop nor Ballmer mentioned Zune, Microsoft's music service that is expected to replace Nokia's offering in music.</p><p>That is because in the past few days, growing evidence suggests Zune is being rebranded and that the name will be dropped. Its <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/presskits/windowsphone/imageGallery.aspx" title="logo was noticeably absent ">logo was noticeably absent </a>from Microsoft's press materials about the tieup.</p><p>A Microsoft spokesperson <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/is-microsoft-zune-about-to-be-kinned/8712?tag=mncol;txt" title="told ZDNet blogger Mary Jo Foley on Tuesday">told ZDNet blogger Mary Jo Foley on Tuesday</a>: "We're not 'killing' any of the Zune services/features in any way. Microsoft remains committed to providing a great music and video experience from Zune on platforms such as Xbox Live, Windows-based PCs, Zune devices and Windows Phone 7, as well as integration with Bing and MSN."</p><p>Elop would have been briefed on whether Zune could be mentioned as a benefit of the Nokia-Microsoft tieup &#8211; and noticeably did not.</p><p>Analysts have marked down Nokia's stock in the expectation that it will have significant restructuring costs and that it will have problems selling Symbian phones in the face of growing competition from rivals as it tries to ramp up production of Windows Phone models.</p><p/><p>Elop has repeatedly refused to offer any timescales for the introduction of Nokia handsets running Windows Phone, saying only that Nokia expects to ship them "in volume" in 2012 and that he expects to sell 150m more Symbian handsets. At current sales rates, that would see the last Symbian handset sold in mid-2012, though a deceleration in sales is highly likely as consumers and mobile retailers discard the old platform.</p><p/><p>On Tuesday he told the Guardian, when challenged on how Nokia could maintain sales if competitors begin to describe Symbian as a dying platform: "Competitors will do whatever they think is right for their business, and, of course, we are going to fight very hard to retain those customers. Note that we have very strong brand equity and we take care of our customers in more countries around the world than anybody else. Our hope is that the good work we do will allow us to defend ourselves against any attacks that may come."</p><p/><p>He declined to say whether Nokia will remain profitable through the year, saying that he had given sufficient financial guidance in a briefing to analysts last Friday &#8211; where he noticeably did not guarantee that Nokia will retain quarter-by-quarter profitability this year.</p><p/><p>Asked whether Nokia was waiting for the next version of Windows Phone to arrive, Microsoft said: "We are not giving any guidance on product details, timings, markets, operators at the moment, but we can say we target to deliver significant volume of Nokia Windows Phones in 2012."</p></div>

That is a long time in the mobile phone industry. Look at where Android was compared to Nokia nine months ago ....

Why announce that you're moving to Windows, and effectively dropping Symbian and MeeGo if customers are unlikely to see anything for a year? It damages Nokia in its current position, without doing anything to help its future position. Surely, it would have made sense to adopt Windows 7 as a platform <i>alongside</i> Symbian and MeeGo, and gradually move developers and marketing effort towards Windows Phone-related projects and products (including, e.g., a tool to aid porting Qt apps to Windows Phone), and only announce the shift to a Windows Phone-centred strategy when the release of Mango is imminent? That way, developers and customers could be kept on-side. The way Elop is going about things, it's almost as if he wants to create negative brand equity for the Nokia brand.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9597398">4</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9597398"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9597398"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9597398" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9597422"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/toguardian" title="User profile page">toguardian</a> <p class="date">16 February 2011 12:28PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>This is a deal from hell.

I can understand Elop not wanting to launch a WinPho7 phone, not many people are convinced by it yet. It would risk alienating users, better to wait until you have a more polished product. The turnaround time is probably too short to develop for WinPho7 anyway with Mango or whatever already on the horizon.</p><p>Also I don't think the kind of person who currently buys a Nokia 'smartphone' knows, or cares, much about the market (cruel but probably true). Elop has effectively admitted that Symbian is not fit for purpose, however it can still be sold to the mid-market and to non-techies as it has some consumer-friendly aspects - expect to see some heavy discounting though!</p><p>Finally it's not as if life support has been cut off just yet. Even when a product is discontinued, there is still an eco-system in place to provide after-sales care. This often happens in the car industry, e.g. when the Insignia replaced the Vectra there were some fantastic deals on the last Vectras (not that I drive one mind, it's just a simile). Most people (who give a hoot) replace their phones at least every 24 months anyway so Symbian isn't a Dodo just yet, as long as Nokia survives that is...</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9601327">2</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9601327"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9601327"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9601327" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9601721"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/AndyLDN" title="User profile page">AndyLDN</a> <p class="date">16 February 2011 4:20PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>Please , Just bring a phone out .

It makes me want to suggest that with Elop's previous loyalty to Microsoft this announcement really only helps his former company. I can imagine them pushing Nokia to make the announcement to shore up confidence in Windows Phone 7.</p><p>It gives investors faith that within the next year a giant outlet for their platform is coming along to boost sales. In terms of Nokia it is a real lash up, if they are really on a burning platform then it's like saying "Oh, I know that I may die if I stay up here but the water looks a bit cold down there, maybe I'll wait 'til the summer in the hope that it heats up, then I'll jump".</p><p>I still get frustrated by the whole buzz around Android being the market leader in the OS game. I'm not really a fan of Apple but I bet you they couldn't give a toss about their share of the Android/Windows Phone 7 market. They have one phone, make a fortune off the hardware, software and apps and are not really chasing any other segments other than that served by the iPhone (right now). </p><p>I think it's kind of like saying if Ford made tyres and they were exclusively fitted to Ford cars and not sold to any other manufacturer that they were losing out in the race for tyre market share. In fact tyres sold on just Ford's would make up a tiny amount of all tyres sold by companies like Pirelli or Michelin.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9603443">0</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9603443"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9603443"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9603443" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9603699"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/GJMW" title="User profile page">GJMW</a> <p class="date">16 February 2011 6:28PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>Makes sense.

I'd wager exactly the same number of iPhone owners know it runs on iOS as Android phone users know their phones are Android. A giant part of Apple's market are the newbies who know pretty much zero about phones and tech in general. That's one of their major selling points. I know it is extremely difficult for a lot of Mac fanboys to comprehend or accept, but there are more people out there who buy Windows and Android out of choice than buy OSX and iPhones out of choice. </i></p><p>Indeed. If you asked the average "iFan" which iOS build number he was currently running he/she would, like a large number of "Droidheads", not have a clue what you were talking about. Indeed I find it rather amusing that on the one hand Apple have a very loyal following amongst many very tech-aware people whilst the company's mass marketing is aimed at the "great unwashed". How cool is that? The fact is (this is demonstrated by the fact that so many smart-phone owners love, for example, HTC's Sense UI or Apples iOS UI ie the skin on top of the os) the customer's immediate experience, without him or her knowing jack-shit about the tech, is the alpha and omega of mass marketing. Any pretence that any particular customer group is more knowledgeable than the next one in the area of modern "shinies" is just rubbish.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9603778">2</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9603778"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9603778"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9603778" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9603807"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/FrederickL" title="User profile page">FrederickL</a> <p class="date">16 February 2011 6:39PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>The first word "indeed" full stop in the above posting should have read "Indeed?"

This is surprising? Nokia's clear intention is that when the first phones are launched they will make as big an impact as possible - hardly surprising either. This will be sometime "earlyish" in 2012 - which was exactly what their CEO said on the company's capital markets day.</p><p>Disclosure. My lady owns an N8 (birthday present from me) loves it and has a little generic Nokia as her backup. I run a Desire Z with a Wildfire as backup (although I have owned more Nokias the last twenty years than you can shake a stick at).

Its partnership with Microsoft is what wolf packs do to a lost lamb. Failure of that partnership will not only be certain, it will be deserved. After months of indecisive caution, Elop opted for a no-brainer. The airhead is still dementedly praising the deal even if the whole world knows that he is holding its sticky end. He is inexplicably nuts over it even as the calls to him to stand down have become a clamour. Everyone is having trouble parsing the logic behind the alliance. But Chairman Jorma Ollila and his ventriloquist&#8217;s dummy Stephen Elop continue to sing hosannas to it. Elop has transformed himself from a putative software technocrat to a voluble &#8216;talknocrat&#8217; in defence of the alliance. Nokia&#8217;s whole leadership went missing when this carpetbagger put Nokia permanently in hock to Microsoft. The servility, stupidity and the docility of airheads in the Board contributed to the making of this bum deal possible. Now they should watch out for the iceberg dead ahead of them.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9610408">1</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9610408"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9610408"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9610408" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9611076"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2011/02/17/plint6/27b27b04-f88b-4575-98e1-4b6ae49260d5/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/plint6" title="User profile page">plint6</a> <p class="date">17 February 2011 11:05AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>Nokia, priority number one: satisfy your customers, not Microsoft</p><p>This announcement by Nokia regarding to the first shipments of WP handsets is a non-event. What we should ask is, when can we expect new handsets from Nokia in stores, even with Symbian3 on it. I already mentioned in other comments that it is a high priority for the existence of Nokia to introduce new handsets the very soonest and/or with a new, fresh and astonishing upgrade of its Symbian3 platform in the beginning of the second quarter of 2011 in the retail stores.</p><p>How hard can this be Nokia. You got all the greatest talent in marketing, innovation, plus not to mention, the money, the millions, the billions. (Otherwise, let's also put it this way, thus from a business point of view (you know, business principles), think about the great ROI you can make, right now the market is hot and booming). There are a lot of great quality handsets and great quality of User Interfaces (UI) and Operating Systems (OS) from other manufacturers. Nokia, take an example from it. Again, that cannot be a hard task for you, as a number one handset manufacturer of the world. </p><p>Nokia, it is your number one priority to satisfy your customers, not to drop them. Again, as i mentioned in other comments,come with specific dates and it is important for you Nokia to come up with ....something... very soon. PUT THE PRESSURE ON IT. </p><p>So, for now, just forget about Microsoft if you really want to built a long term relationship with them.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9611076">2</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9611076"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9611076"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9611076" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9611304"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/AndyLDN" title="User profile page">AndyLDN</a> <p class="date">17 February 2011 11:18AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>I cant see the problem....</p><p>Nokia have an N9 (unreleased)<br/>Microsoft have an OS <br/>Crazy idea but what if the 2 products where put together.</p><p>The N9 specs seemed to be fantastic .It cant be hard to put the wp7 OS on there . </p><p><br/>I understand the wait but ....

It was a stretch, I'm on the dole.<br/>I decided the OS was good, plenty of apps, now, and in the future. I expected it to last me 4-5 years. I change phones less often than some of the 'commentards' change their socks. Only just, I admit but...<br/>It runs symbian.<br/>The day after the announcement came out, I (living in Finland) checked out the employment office's database for all jobs for the last month in all of Finland with "Symbian" as a keyword.<br/>Got 14. Now, in the city I live, I'd usually expect 20. Whole of Finland? Couple of weeks ago, I'd normally see 100 or so.<br/>That was Saturday.<br/>Tuesday, 8 jobs. <br/>Today (Thursday) 1job. The latter was an afterthought, as in "Symbian knowledge may be an advantage".<br/>I cannot see anyone buying Nokia's flagship phone (believe me, it's excellent!) on the basis that the OS won't be supported soon. At &#8364;450 a pop (or &#8364;19/month contract), that's gotta hurt. Big time.<br/>As I'm on a 2-year contract, maybe I can take it back, on the basis that Nokia has defaulted - I expect support for the life of the contract.
