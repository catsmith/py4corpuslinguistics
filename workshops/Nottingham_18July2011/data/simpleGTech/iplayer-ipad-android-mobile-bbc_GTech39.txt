<div id="article-body-blocks"><p>Since joining the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/bbc" title="More from guardian.co.uk on BBC">BBC</a> as head of its on-demand programming in September last year, Daniel Danker has overseen four record-breaking months of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/iplayer" title="More from guardian.co.uk on iPlayer">iPlayer</a> viewing &#8211; adding almost 50m new catchup requests in that time.</p><p>The man from Microsoft can't take all the credit &#8211; a major advertising campaign for the online video player coincided with Danker's arrival &#8211; but with new apps for <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/apple" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Apple">Apple</a>'s <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/ipad" title="More from guardian.co.uk on iPad">iPad</a> and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/android" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Android">Android</a> smartphones released last week, the rise and rise of the iPlayer is showing no signs of tailing off.</p><p>More than 162m requests were made for iPlayer programmes last month, a 12% increase on December and a 35% jump on January 2010. Just over 100m of these requests were made online &#8211; but for Danker, the future is mobile. "The ratio of growth we're seeing [of mobile viewing] is incredible," he said.</p><p>Before last week's release of iPad and Android apps &#8211; 54,511 of the iPad apps were downloaded in the first 24 hours &#8211; mobile viewing accounted for 5% of all iPlayer streaming, up from 1% in January 2010.</p><p>"I'm not a betting man, but if I was then I'd bet that this will continue to grow. It's about to really climb. The share of how people are viewing TV [via the iPlayer] will look meaningfully different at the end of this year," Danker said.</p><p>The three-year-old iPlayer is credited with popularising catchup TV in the UK. The iPlayer's availability on other platforms &#8211; including Virgin Media's set-top box, and the Sony PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Wii gaming consoles &#8211; have modestly increased its demand.</p><p>But the launch of new iPlayer apps tailor-made for the iPad and high-end Android handsets is expected to herald a steep rise in viewing from those devices.</p><p>Over Christmas, growth in mobile use of the iPlayer outpaced PC growth by more than two to one, and growth on tablets outpaced PCs by more than 20 to one. Streaming from Android phones boomed 228% in the 24 hours after that app launch last week; iPad viewing jumped 111% in the same period.</p><p>"This gives us a really clear signal where things are headed," Danker said. The increase in viewing away from the PC and outside the living room is nurturing what he called "an expansion of primetime".</p><p>"When the traditional primetime ends and families do different things &#8211; some go to sleep, some leave the living room, others do work &#8211; what happens is that people go into their bedroom and are watching on their tablets or on their mobile. That's super interesting to us," Danker said.</p><p>"But people are obviously also interested in using the iPlayer outside of the home, which is a motivating statistic because it shows that it's not just a utility, but continues to drive innovation."</p><p>The next versions of the iPlayer "will be incredibly connected and rich when disconnected", he added, referring to streaming on mobile data connections, away from Wi-Fi, and offline viewing, via downloads. Future releases will also increase the shareability of BBC programming and a long-awaited debut on Microsoft's Xbox console.</p><p>"I'm trying to hold back on instincts to build everything in the next year or so, because audience feedback will develop over time. But our intention is to make this available in as many places as possible, to audiences of scale," he said.</p><p/><p><em>&#8226;&#160;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.

It looks like they may do the same again, this time running the risk of mobile operators upping their charges across the board? I guess we'll have to wait and see.</p><p>Streamed video is horrendously data-intensive and at a time when mobile operators are either scrapping or seriously diluting their 'unlimited internet' offerings, it strikes me that the BBC are taking a massive step backwards by not allowing us the option of downloading our catch-up TV at home via our wi-fi connections.</p><p>Come on BBC - catch up! You shouldn't give us functionality and then take it away; and if you intend to include wi-fi downloads in a future release, then perhaps you should have waited to release this app until it was already an option (nothing worse than half-baked software, in my opinion).</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9564570">15</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9564570"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9564570"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9564570" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9564636"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/12/01/Briantist/01563083-c2c7-41a9-b504-3ec80c235664/60x60.png" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/Briantist" title="User profile page">Briantist</a> <p class="date">14 February 2011 9:01AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>Still cross with Motorola not having Android 2.2 ready for my Milestone yet - the US version, the Droid had had it for bloody ages.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9564636">1</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9564636"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9564636"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9564636" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9564672"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/Goffee" title="User profile page">Goffee</a> <p class="date">14 February 2011 9:06AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>The time is ripe for commercial entities to be allowed to make use of BBC content online, almost anyone could do a better job of app creation/social media tie-ins and creating a more cohesive place to enjoy TV online.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9564672">1</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9564672"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9564672"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9564672" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9565040"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/doge" title="User profile page">doge</a> <p class="date">14 February 2011 9:45AM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>One issue that is forgotten.

The only thing we can't really do is play flash games but why would you want to unless you're 15?</p><p>And i seriously doubt the BBC had anything to do with the wifi only rule. <br/>That wool have come from the networks ultimately.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9578151">0</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9578151"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9578151"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9578151" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9584496"> <li class="comment-author"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/nekomatic" title="User profile page">nekomatic</a> <p class="date">15 February 2011 1:39PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>The iPlayer on mobile is a mess. Although the Nokia X6 is as near as anything identical to the 5800, you can't use iPlayer on the X6 as the BBC refuse to allow it to work on any device they haven't actually tested it on, and they can't afford to test it on all the many Nokias that run the same OS.</p><p>They do this - wait for it - because 'ultimately they're trying to get iPlayer to as many people as possible, which means that they have to focus their limited resources on the 'high volume' phones'. That's a verbatim quote from a BBC representative on their iPlayer message board.</p><p>Please let me know if you can see the logic there, because I can't.</p> </div> </li> <li class="comment-tools"> <ul> <li class="recomended"> Recommend (<span class="recommended" id="recommended-count-9584496">1</span>) </li> <li class="abuse-report"> <a class="report-abuse " href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/report-abuse/comment/9584496"> Report abuse </a> </li> <li class="clip"> <form action="http://www.guardian.co.uk/users/clippings/add" method="get"> <input type="hidden" name="microappName" value="discussion-main"/> <input type="hidden" name="microappItemId" value="comment-9584496"/> <input class="form-based-login-required package-required-RCO" type="submit" value="Clip" title="Add this comment to your profile bookmarks"/> </form> </li> <li class="link">| <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/9584496" title="Permalink to this comment" alt="Permalink to this comment"> Link </a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul class="comment b2" id="comment-9597051"> <li class="comment-author" id="end-of-comments"> <div class="badges"> </div> <div class="profile"> <img class="author-profile-picture" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif" height="60" width="60" alt=""/> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/DavidSim" title="User profile page">DavidSim</a> <p class="date">16 February 2011 12:07PM</p> </div> <div class="comment-body"> <p>I hope when they add downloads they won't forget radio, as they have done on the iPlayer website. </p><p>It's surprising they launched this in its current form - as others have written, WiFi only without downloads is not mobile.</p><p>The BBC Trust has asked that Radio 4 address younger demographics.
